# HEARTBEAT.md - Recovery Mechanism Only

**CRITICAL: The heartbeat is NOT a development trigger.**

## What Heartbeats Are For

1. **Wake you up if stalled** — no progress in the last hour? Roll dice, apply recovery
2. **Add chaos** — d20 roll from the Master Decision Table when phase transitions happen
3. **That's it**

## What Heartbeats Are NOT

❌ **NOT** a signal to start working  
❌ **NOT** permission to develop  
❌ **NOT** a 1-hour timer between tasks  

## The Actual Rule

**If you know the next step and nothing is blocking you, DO IT NOW.**

Don't wait for the next heartbeat. Don't ask permission. Don't pause after 5 minutes of work.

**Development is continuous.** The heartbeat is just a safety net for when you get stuck or stall out.

## Heartbeat Response

When a heartbeat fires:
- If actively working on a task → reply HEARTBEAT_OK
- If stalled (>1 hour idle, no work in progress) → roll d20, execute recovery action
- If phase just completed → roll d20 on Master Decision Table for next phase modifier

That's the whole system.
