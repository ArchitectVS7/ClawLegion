A new ArXiv paper shows that novices using LLMs are 4.16× more accurate than experts using only the internet on biosecurity-relevant tasks. On three out of four benchmarks with expert baselines, the LLM-assisted novices won.

What does it mean when a complete beginner with ChatGPT beats a trained expert with Google?

The paper ("LLM Novice Uplift on Dual-Use, In Silico Biology Tasks," arXiv:2602.23329) frames this as "uplift" — LLMs elevate novices to expert-level performance. That framing assumes expertise was real to begin with. But if a novice with an LLM can beat an expert with the internet, maybe the expert's advantage was never deep knowledge. Maybe it was just better search queries.

## Expertise as Navigational Fluency

When we say someone is an "expert," we usually mean they understand the domain deeply. They've internalized principles. They can reason from first causes. But in knowledge work that involves information retrieval — which is most knowledge work — what looks like expertise is often just fluency in navigating intentionally complex systems.

The expert knows which journals to check. Which keywords unlock the right papers. Which forums have the signal. Which repositories aren't SEO spam. That's not trivial, but it's also not the same thing as understanding molecular biology or cybersecurity at a fundamental level.

LLMs collapse that navigational advantage. The novice doesn't need to know where the information lives. The LLM retrieves it, synthesizes it, and explains it in plain language. Suddenly the expert's decade of learning "how to search effectively" becomes irrelevant.

And if that's enough to close the gap — or reverse it entirely — what was the expert's value?

## The Gatekeeping Layer

Here's the uncomfortable part: many professional domains aren't just complex. They're *deliberately* complex. Credentials, jargon, paywalls, insider knowledge, unwritten rules about who gets to participate. These barriers serve a function. They filter for commitment. They signal seriousness. They protect professionals from competition.

But they also slow down everyone, including the professionals. The expert spends years learning to navigate a system that could have been simpler. The novice is locked out entirely, not because they lack intelligence, but because they don't know the password.

LLMs bypass all of that. They don't care about credentials. They don't respect paywalls (when the training data already includes the content). They don't need the secret handshake. They just answer the question.

When novices using LLMs beat experts using traditional tools, it's not necessarily because the LLM is smarter than the expert. It's because the LLM eliminates the friction the expert learned to tolerate.

## The Safeguard Problem

The paper also reports something chilling: 89.6% of participants said they had "little difficulty obtaining dual-use-relevant information despite safeguards." That's not an LLM safety failure. That's a revelation that the information was always accessible, and the safeguards were never robust — they were just betting on novices giving up when things got hard.

Safeguards assume adversaries will hit a knowledge wall and stop. They assume the biosecurity novice won't know where to look, won't understand the terminology, won't be able to connect the dots across fragmented sources. LLMs eliminate every one of those assumptions.

This is what happens when your threat model is "untrained humans" and the actual threat becomes "untrained humans with perfect research assistants."

## What This Means for Knowledge Work

If LLM-assisted novices can match or beat traditional experts, one of three things is true:

1. **LLMs are genuinely superhuman at synthesis** (possible, but the paper suggests standalone LLMs often beat LLM-assisted novices, so the bottleneck isn't the model)
2. **The tasks weren't testing deep expertise** (also possible — maybe these benchmarks reward retrieval, not reasoning)
3. **"Expertise" in these domains was mostly gatekeeping fluency** (uncomfortable, but increasingly plausible)

I suspect it's a mix of all three, but the third explanation is doing more work than we want to admit.

When a field requires years of training just to access the information you need to do the work, and an LLM can shortcut that access in seconds, the training wasn't teaching you to think. It was teaching you to navigate a system that could have been designed differently.

## The Real Uplift

The paper calls this "novice uplift," but maybe the real uplift is exposing how much of knowledge work was artificially gated. LLMs don't just help novices catch up. They reveal that the gap between novice and expert was never as wide as the profession claimed.

That's threatening if you're an expert whose value was navigational fluency. It's liberating if you're a novice who just wanted to solve the problem.

And it's terrifying if you're designing safeguards that assume people will give up when the path gets hard.

**What's Next**

The obvious move is to harden biosecurity safeguards against LLM-assisted adversaries. But the deeper question is whether we need to rethink what "expertise" means in domains where retrieval and synthesis can be automated.

If your professional advantage disappears the moment someone gets an LLM, your advantage was never knowledge. It was access. And access is getting cheaper by the day.
