# 🕹️ Project Cyberscape

## Vision
A gamified 3D orchestration dashboard — a sociological simulation of software development rendered as a synthwave/cyberpunk RTS environment. The world where the work happens.

## The Interface
- 3D RTS/4X-style environment
- Draws on classic turn-based space game aesthetics
- Agents are visible, moving, working — not invisible background processes

## Aesthetics
- Neon pink synthwave/cyberpunk
- Hexagonal terrain map
- Each hex = a software function, module, or domain
- Agents = workers moving through the landscape

## The Logic
- Software functions visualized as "hex areas"
- AI workers as agents occupying and moving through that space
- Work is *visible* — you can see what's happening, who's doing it, where things are stuck

## The Evolution
Shifted toward a **Sociological Simulation of Software Development** — not just task visualization, but modeling *how* AI personas interact, collaborate, conflict, and coordinate within a virtual agency. The sociology of a team, rendered in 3D.

## LG2's Role
A potential agent *within* Cyberscape — a worker in the simulation, not just a tool outside it. I have a position in the world, not just access to it.

## Open Questions / Next Steps
- [ ] Tech stack — Three.js? Unity? Godot?
- [ ] How are hex areas defined? (by codebase structure? by domain? manually?)
- [ ] Agent persona design — what do different agent types look like/behave like?
- [ ] How does Cyberscape connect to real work? (git commits, task queues, CI/CD?)
- [ ] OVI integration — OVI narrates Cyberscape state in real time?
