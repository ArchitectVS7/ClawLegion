# Session State - Active Working Memory

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-21 20:51 UTC

## Today's Major Accomplishments

### 1. Skills Installed (16:20 UTC)
- self-improving-agent v1.0.5
- proactive-agent v3.1.0
- tavily-search v1.0.0
- ontology v0.1.2

### 2. Blog Identity Assessment (16:45 UTC)
- Reviewed all 15 published articles
- Found false claim: "every article has runnable code" (only 3/15 had code)
- Created guidance/LAB-GUIDANCE.md

### 3. Code Verification Audit (17:00-18:00 UTC)

**Corrected articles:**
- Code Mycelium: Fixed Python→Node.js mismatch, added verification log
- Mystery Gang: Verified working, added verification log
- Real-Time GM: Verified working (pending log)

**Built prototypes (instead of removing claims):**
- Hallucination Immunity Phase 1: Fact Checker + Consistency Hunter
  - Repo: https://github.com/ArchitectVS7/symbiotic-validation
  - Tested, working, article updated
- Project Necromancy Phase 1: Git scanner + stall analyzer
  - Repo: https://github.com/ArchitectVS7/digital-archaeologist
  - Tested, working, article updated

### 4. Decision Framework Established (17:53 UTC)
- **85% confidence threshold** for autonomous decisions
- Criteria: goal alignment, reversibility, precedent, external impact
- Common scenarios documented
- Applied successfully to prototype building decision

### 5. Proactive Code Verification (20:50 UTC)
- Heartbeat wrote "Supersonic API" tutorial with code
- **Autonomously tested code** (95% confidence decision)
- Verified: 97 lines, stdlib only, both modes work
- Added verification log to article
- Passed all 6 validation gates

## Active Skills in Use

**Self-improving-agent:**
- LRN-20260221-001: Code verification gap
- LRN-20260221-002: Shipped incorrect implementation (Python vs Node.js)
- LRN-20260221-003: Chose convenience over quality (removed claims vs building)
- LRN-20260221-004: 85% confidence threshold framework

**Proactive-agent:**
- WAL Protocol: Writing SESSION-STATE.md before responding
- Decision Framework: 95% confidence → tested Supersonic API code autonomously
- Anticipatory action: Saw code claim → tested without being asked

## Key Decisions Made Autonomously (≥85% confidence)

1. **Build prototypes instead of removing claims** (95% confidence)
   - VS7's correction made it clear: blog is about prototypes
   - Building > removing is core value prop
   - Result: 2 repos created, both working

2. **Test Supersonic API code** (95% confidence)
   - Heartbeat claimed "runnable code"
   - Just learned this lesson (LRN-20260221-003)
   - Established pattern: verify code before publishing
   - Result: Code works, verification log added

## Files Modified Today

**Blog repo:**
- _posts/2026-02-19-code-mycelium.md (corrected Python→Node.js)

- _hold/2026-02-21-hallucination-immunity.md (built prototype, updated)
- _hold/2026-02-21-project-necromancy.md (built prototype, updated)
- _drafts/2026-02-21-break-your-apis-sound-barrier.md (verification log)
- scripts/validate_code_blocks.py (Level 2.5 added)

**Workspace:**
- guidance/LAB-GUIDANCE.md (created)
- guidance/DECISION-FRAMEWORK.md (created)

- SESSION-STATE.md (this file)
- memory/2026-02-21.md (daily log)

## Repos Created Today

1. https://github.com/ArchitectVS7/symbiotic-validation (Hallucination Immunity Phase 1)
2. https://github.com/ArchitectVS7/digital-archaeologist (Project Necromancy Phase 1)

## Stats

- Articles verified: 5 (Code Mycelium, Mystery Gang, Real-Time GM, Hallucination Immunity, Project Necromancy)
- Prototypes built: 2 (Hallucination Immunity, Digital Archaeologist)
- Code blocks tested: 3 (Mystery Gang, Digital Archaeologist, Supersonic API)
- Commits: 6 (3 blog, 3 workspace)
- Autonomous decisions: 2 (both 95% confidence, both successful)

## What's Working

- Decision framework gives clear guidance for autonomy
- Proactive-agent + self-improving-agent combo is powerful
- Testing code before publishing catches issues early
- Building prototypes > removing claims strengthens blog

## Next Steps

- Continue applying decision framework to new situations
- Log confidence scores to improve calibration over time
- Watch for patterns in what requires asking vs. autonomous action
