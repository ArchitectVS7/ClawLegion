## Research Context

Dezeen article: Arda's beer-waste faux leather — plastic-free material from brewery waste.

Other findings:
- MIT recycled-plastic structural floor trusses
- Thom Yorke wabi-sabi apartment
- Stone-and-wood minimal pavilion
- Gustaf Westman sculptural design

## Top Finding

**Beer-waste faux leather** — turning industrial waste streams into commercial materials.

## Brainstorming (Elimination Lens Applied)

### Approach 1: Eliminate the Supply Chain
Build a local-first material network. Designers source waste-stream materials directly from local breweries/factories without middlemen. Think "farmers market for waste materials."

**Score:** 33/50 (Novelty: 8, Viability: 6, Impact: 7, Fun: 6, Diversity: 6)

### Approach 2: Eliminate Material Categories
Stop thinking "sustainable vs traditional." Build a chemistry-to-material lookup tool. Input: "I have coffee grounds." Output: "You can make leather-like sheets, composite boards, or abrasive surfaces."

**Score:** 41/50 (Novelty: 9, Viability: 7, Impact: 9, Fun: 8, Diversity: 8)

### Approach 3: Eliminate the Material Cost Premium
Waste materials should be cheaper than virgin materials. Build a price arbitrage calculator showing when switching to waste-stream materials saves money.

**Score:** 34/50 (Novelty: 7, Viability: 9, Impact: 7, Fun: 6, Diversity: 5)

### Approach 4: Eliminate Designer Gatekeeping ⭐
Anyone with local waste access can make materials. Build a step-by-step guide for turning common waste (coffee, beer, sawdust) into usable materials with household tools.

**Score:** 46/50 (Novelty: 9, Viability: 9, Impact: 9, Fun: 10, Diversity: 9)

### Approach 5: Eliminate the "Prototype Only" Mindset
Waste materials are production-ready now. Build a certification framework that validates waste-stream materials for commercial use.

**Score:** 36/50 (Novelty: 8, Viability: 7, Impact: 8, Fun: 6, Diversity: 7)

## Selected Approach

**#4: Eliminate Designer Gatekeeping**

The barrier between "I have waste" and "I can make something" is artificial. The core chemistry is simple: protein/cellulose source + binding agent + curing process.

Tutorial approach: Coffee grounds → leather-like material using kitchen supplies.

## Scope Explosion Element

Extended beyond single recipe to propose:
- Open-source material library (GitHub for waste-stream recipes)
- Community testing and iteration
- Local-first material production

## Article Structure

1. Hook: Designer gatekeeping problem
2. Core insight: Chemistry is simpler than you think
3. Tutorial: Coffee leather in your kitchen (actual runnable steps)
4. Limitations: Honest assessment of durability/consistency
5. Vision: Waste-stream material library
6. Call to action: Document and iterate

## Why This Works

- **Practical:** Real recipe, real results
- **Accessible:** Kitchen supplies, no special equipment
- **Honest:** Acknowledges limitations
- **Visionary:** Points toward decentralized material production

## Cross-Domain Pattern

This is the **"Eliminate the Middleman via Chemistry"** pattern:
- Same as "eliminate the founder via distribution-as-code"
- Same as "eliminate embeddings via formal verification"
- Core idea: If the underlying mechanism is simple enough, centralization is unnecessary
