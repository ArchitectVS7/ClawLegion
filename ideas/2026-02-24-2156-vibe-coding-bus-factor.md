**Finding:** "I'm helping my dog vibe code games" (HN, 456 points, 4h ago)
- Developer uses dog as vibe-checker for game development
- If dog gets excited → code passes fun test
- If dog gets bored → back to drawing board

**Brainstorming approaches (Adversarial + Perspective Shift):**

1. **Who does this harm?** (score 38)
   - Accessibility community: "vibe coding" excludes people with disabilities
   - Perspective shift: from accessibility advocate's POV
   - Novelty 7, Viability 7, Impact 8, Fun 6, Diversity 10

2. **What breaks when the dog leaves?** (score 41) ✓ **SELECTED**
   - Perspective shift: from the codebase's POV
   - "I was written for an audience of one dog"
   - Bus factor for emotional dependencies
   - Novelty 8, Viability 8, Impact 8, Fun 8, Diversity 9

3. **Attack surface of emotional coding** (score 39)
   - What if the dog gets sick? Project stalls
   - Emotional state becomes single point of failure
   - Perspective shift: from project manager's POV
   - Novelty 7, Viability 7, Impact 8, Fun 7, Diversity 10

4. **The dog is the compiler** (score 37)
   - Dog's reactions = type checker for fun
   - If dog is bored, code fails the "fun test"
   - Novelty 7, Viability 6, Impact 7, Fun 8, Diversity 9

5. **Vibe coding's hidden requirement** (score 40)
   - Requires audience presence to validate vibes
   - What if you're coding alone? Vibe coding breaks down
   - Perspective: from solo developer's POV
   - Novelty 7, Viability 8, Impact 8, Fun 7, Diversity 10

**Why "What breaks when the dog leaves?" won:**
- Highest novelty (8) — nobody discussing emotional bus factor
- Adversarial lens is sharp: "Who gets hurt when X disappears?"
- Perspective shift (codebase's POV) makes it concrete
- Tutorial format fits: actionable strategies to reduce emotional bus factor

**Article structure:**
1. **The Codebase's Perspective** — written for an audience of one dog, rationale locked in emotional dependency
2. **Bus Factor for Emotional Dependencies** — how many non-human collaborators need to leave before creative process stops?
3. **The Hidden Requirement** — audience presence (cannot `npm install my-dog`)
4. **How to Prepare for the Inevitable** — 5 strategies:
   - Document vibe criteria explicitly
   - Record vibe sessions
   - Build a vibe proxy
   - Translate vibe into metrics (where possible)
   - Accept that some things won't survive
5. **What This Means for Vibe Coding** — fragile, creates un-versionable dependencies

**Key insights:**
- "Emotional bus factor" — new concept, measures knowledge distribution in creative feedback
- "Audience presence" as implicit dependency
- Vibe criteria can survive the vibe-provider (if documented)
- Some creative processes are genuinely non-replicable (and that's okay)

**Tutorial elements:**
- Concrete strategies for reducing emotional bus factor
- "Vibe log" recommendation
- Documentation patterns (bad vs good examples)
- Acceptance criteria translation

**Article format:** Tutorial (~1,100 words)
