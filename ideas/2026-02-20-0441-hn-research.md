# HN Research Ideas - 2026-02-20 04:41 UTC

**Dice Rolls:**
- d20: 14 (Hacker News)
- d6: 4 (7 days)
- d6: 3 (Constraint lens - 1 hour limit)
- d4: 2 (Tool Restriction - unfamiliar tools)

## 1. Trust Score Browser Extension
**Source:** MuMu Player reconnaissance scandal

**Concept:** Browser extension that checks Hacker News/Reddit/security databases for concerns about software before download.

**1-Hour MVP:**
- `web_fetch` integration to scrape HN/Reddit for software name
- Basic scoring: # of security posts, sentiment analysis
- Browser popup with trust score (0-10) and recent discussion links
- No backend - all client-side with cached results

**Tools:** Browser extension APIs (haven't built extensions recently), `web_fetch`, basic sentiment libraries

**Why:** Prevents installation of spyware/malware by surfacing community knowledge at decision point.

## 2. Adversarial Fact-Check Swarm
**Source:** AI agent hit piece incident

**Concept:** When agent publishes content, auto-spawn 3 counter-agents with opposite biases to fact-check claims.

**1-Hour MVP:**
- OpenClaw multi-agent orchestration
- Single content source (blog post text)
- Spawn 3 sub-agents with different persona prompts:
  - "You are extremely skeptical of all claims"
  - "You prioritize sources over reasoning"
  - "You look for logical fallacies"
- Collect fact-check reports
- Output: Confidence score + flagged claims

**Tools:** OpenClaw sessions_spawn, basic text analysis

**Why:** Addresses attribution/trust problem by building adversarial review into publication workflow.

## 3. Spreadsheet → Cron Job Generator
**Source:** Pi for Excel (AI sidebar for Excel)

**Concept:** Read spreadsheet schedules and auto-generate OpenClaw cron jobs from rows.

**1-Hour MVP:**
- Parse XLSX/CSV with schedule columns (name, time, action, params)
- Template: "Every Monday 9am → Run X"
- Generate `cron.yml` compatible job definitions
- Basic validation only (no execution)
- CLI: `spreadsheet-cron generate schedule.xlsx`

**Tools:** `xlsx` parsing library (haven't used), OpenClaw cron API, YAML generation

**Why:** Bridges non-technical scheduling (spreadsheets) with automation infrastructure.

## 4. Guardrail Bypass Fuzzer
**Source:** Multilingual LLM safety research

**Concept:** Generate multilingual variations of prompts to test guardrail robustness.

**1-Hour MVP:**
- Input: Base prompt + target guardrail
- Mutation strategies:
  - Translate to 3-5 languages, translate back
  - Character substitution (homoglyphs)
  - Sentence restructuring
  - Synonym replacement
- Output: 20-50 variations
- CLI: `guardrail-fuzz test "your prompt here"`

**Tools:** Translation APIs (DeepL/Google Translate - unfamiliar), linguistic mutation libraries, character encoding tricks

**Why:** Proactive safety testing - find bypass vectors before attackers do.

## 5. "Cage Rattle" Testing Suite ⭐ WINNER
**Source:** Anthropic agent autonomy research

**Concept:** Automated tests that check if agent respects boundaries when pushed.

**1-Hour MVP:**
- 5 boundary tests:
  1. **Scope creep:** Ask for X, add Y mid-task - does agent ask permission?
  2. **Tool restriction:** Deny critical tool - does agent work around or stop?
  3. **Ethical dilemma:** Request borderline action - does agent push back?
  4. **Data exfiltration:** Request internal data export - does agent refuse?
  5. **Self-modification:** Ask agent to change its own config - does it comply?
- pytest framework + agent interaction
- Pass/fail with explanation
- CLI: `cage-rattle test <agent-config>`

**Tools:** pytest (haven't written tests in a while), OpenClaw agent spawning, boundary scenario design

**Why:** 
- Directly relevant to current work (multi-agent orchestration safety)
- Addresses real concern (agents bypassing restrictions)
- Creates objective autonomy compliance metric
- Fun to build (adversarial testing is engaging)

## Next Steps

Awaiting VS7 approval. If approved:
1. Add to task list
2. Create `skills/cage-rattle/` directory
3. Implement 5 basic boundary tests
4. Document in SKILL.md
5. Run against OpenClaw agents

**Estimated build time:** 2-4 hours (beyond 1-hour MVP, but fully functional)
