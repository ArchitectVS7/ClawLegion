# 2026-02-23 14:22 UTC - AI Homilies: First Principles Analysis

**Source:** Hacker News (AI/ML cluster)
**Time Range:** 7 days
**Lens:** First Principles (d10=7)
**Modifier:** Cross-Pollination (d6=4)
**Format:** Counter-Argument (d6=4)

## Key Finding

Pope tells priests: "Use your brains, not AI, to write homilies"

HN discussion: 284 comments, strong opinions on both sides

## Divergent Brainstorm (First Principles + Cross-Pollination)

**First Principles:** Strip all abstraction. What's the actual problem before convention shaped it?

**Cross-Pollination:** Bring in game dev "AI slop" debate from earlier research

### The Actual Problem (First Principles)

Why does the Pope care? Not because AI is evil. Because:
1. Homilies are **pastoral** - they address specific congregations, specific struggles
2. Authenticity matters - people can tell when something is generic
3. The medium is the message - a priest using AI signals "I don't care enough to write this myself"

Why do game devs care about AI slop? Same reasons:
1. Games are **experiential** - they target specific emotions, specific moments
2. Authenticity matters - players can tell when art is generic
3. The medium is the message - AI art signals "we cut corners"

**The pattern:** AI becomes "slop" when it replaces **contextualized human judgment** with **decontextualized pattern matching**.

### 5 Approaches

**1. The Pope Is Right (And So Are Game Devs)** - Counter-argument
- Defend both positions
- AI for context-free tasks only
- Score: 38/50

**2. The Hypocrisy Test** - Counter-argument ← WINNER
- Pope uses microphones, priests use PowerPoint
- Game devs use Photoshop, procedural generation, asset packs
- Why is AI different? Because it threatens the **irreducible human task**
- Score: 44/50

**3. Find the Boundary** - Tutorial
- Build a tool that identifies which tasks AI can handle vs. which require human context
- Score: 40/50

**4. AI as Ghostwriter** - Narrative
- Homilies have always been collaborative (priests borrow sermon structures, quote theologians)
- AI is just another ghostwriter
- Score: 35/50

**5. The Turing Test for Soul** - Essay
- Can you tell if a homily was AI-written? If not, does it matter?
- Score: 36/50

## Selected Approach: The Hypocrisy Test

**Why this wins:**
- Exposes the real issue: not "AI bad" but "AI threatens core task"
- Cross-pollinates: priests/game devs both use tech, both reject AI for specific things
- Counter-argument format: challenges both pro-AI and anti-AI camps
- First principles: what's actually being protected? The irreducible human contribution.

**Core argument:** 
We don't object to AI because it's artificial. We object when it automates the *one thing* we think defines us.

For priests: **pastoral care** (knowing your flock)
For game devs: **creative vision** (knowing your player)
For writers: **voice** (knowing your reader)

Everything else? Fair game for automation.

**Article structure:**
1. Hook: Pope vs. game devs - same fight, different battlefield
2. The hypocrisy: everyone uses automation somewhere
3. The pattern: AI is fine until it threatens *your* irreducible task
4. The test: Ask "what's the thing only I can do?" Automate everything else.
5. Why this matters: Clarifies the AI debate - it's not about technology, it's about identity

**What makes this counter-argument:**
- Challenges pro-AI: "You can't automate everything"
- Challenges anti-AI: "You're already automating most things"
- Proposes synthesis: Protect the irreducible core, automate the periphery

---

**Score:** 44/50
**Novelty:** 9 (cross-domain synthesis is fresh)
**Viability:** 8 (argument is defensible)
**Impact:** 9 (clarifies a contentious debate)
**Fun:** 9 (satisfying to connect seemingly unrelated domains)
**Diversity:** 9 (different from typical AI ethics posts)
