# Digital Archaeologist Agent

**Created:** 2026-02-20 14:41 UTC  
**Source:** HN Heartbeat Research  
**Dice:** d20=14, d6=3, d6=5, d4=2  
**Lens:** Composition (combine unrelated concepts)  
**Modifier:** Tool Restriction  

## Concept

An autonomous agent that excavates "lost" creative work from personal digital archives using local AI inference.

## Inspiration Synthesis

- **ggml.ai + Hugging Face:** Local AI infrastructure for privacy-first analysis
- **17k tokens/sec:** Fast inference enables scanning large archives
- **Hokusai Lost Sketches:** Rediscovery of forgotten creative work
- **Stripe Minions:** Agentic patterns for autonomous execution

## Core Features

1. **Archive Scanning**
   - Traverse git repos, old drives, cloud backups
   - Identify projects, drafts, experiments, artwork
   - Extract context from fragments (README, commits, file patterns)

2. **Context Reconstruction**
   - Use local LLM to infer project intent from sparse clues
   - Cross-reference timestamps, dependencies, related files
   - Build narrative of "what this was meant to be"

3. **Curation & Exhibition**
   - Categorize by theme, era, technology, mood
   - Generate "museum cards" for each discovery
   - Create browsable gallery of forgotten work

4. **Pattern Analysis**
   - Identify recurring themes across years
   - Find abandoned ideas worth revisiting
   - Detect evolution of style/approach over time

## Technical Approach

- **Local inference:** ggml/llama.cpp for privacy
- **Fast scanning:** Leverage 17k token/sec patterns for bulk analysis
- **Agent coordination:** OpenClaw sub-agent for autonomous operation
- **Storage:** SQLite for metadata, markdown for exhibits

## Brainstorm Alternatives (Full List)

**A: Local AI + Art Curation** (37/50)
- Personal creative work rediscovery tool
- Style/theme pattern matching

**B: Ubiquitous Speed + Agent Orchestration** (32/50)
- Ultra-fast OpenClaw coordination layer
- Pre-computed response caching

**C: Art-Inspired Code Review** (36/50)
- Visual composition principles for code
- Aesthetic-based architecture review

**D: Local AI Investment Tracker** (35/50)
- Tech funding pattern analysis
- Industry shift prediction

**E: Digital Archaeologist Agent** (40/50) ⭐ **SELECTED**
- Lost project excavation
- Context reconstruction from fragments

## Why This One?

- **High novelty:** Unique angle on local AI
- **Personal value:** Everyone has forgotten projects
- **Emotional resonance:** Rediscovery creates meaning
- **Composable:** Combines 4 unrelated HN threads elegantly
- **Chaos factor:** What will we find in the archives?

## Next Steps (If Approved)

1. Prototype archive scanner (git repo traversal)
2. Test context reconstruction with ggml
3. Build simple exhibit generator
4. Run on VS7's project archives
5. Iterate based on discoveries

## Status

Awaiting VS7 approval. If yes → add to task list and begin prototyping.
