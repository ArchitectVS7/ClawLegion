## Dice Rolls
- d20: 7 → Hacker News
- d6 (time): 3 → 7 days, 30 items
- d6 (lens): 4 → Analogy (nature/music/games)

## Brainstorming (Analogy Lens)

### 1. Nature - Symbiosis (Parasitic AI)
Build a "barnacle agent" that attaches to existing workflows, passively observing and suggesting optimizations without replacing the host tool.

**Pros:** Non-invasive, learns organically  
**Cons:** Requires extensive monitoring infrastructure

### 2. Music - Amplifier (AI Effects Chain)
Create an "effects pedal" system where each agent is a different effect:
- Distortion = creative chaos
- Reverb = memory recall
- Delay = temporal analysis
- Chorus = multi-perspective synthesis

Chain agents to amplify human input through sequential transformations.

**Pros:** Modular, composable, musically intuitive  
**Cons:** Complex routing logic needed

### 3. Games - Power-ups (Temporary Capability Boosts)
Design temporary mode switches for OpenClaw:
- Speed Mode (faster responses, minimal thinking)
- Chaos Mode (random tool selection for divergent thinking)
- Focus Mode (single-task lockdown, no interruptions)

**Pros:** Simple to implement, immediate impact  
**Cons:** Limited novelty, doesn't extend capabilities

### 4. Nature - Tool Use (AI Tool Discovery Agent) ⭐
Watch how VS7 uses existing tools, autonomously search for better/complementary tools, propose integrations.

Like how crows learn to use tools by observing other crows - but the AI actively searches the ecosystem for innovations.

**Pros:** High autonomy, extends VS7's reach, proactive learning  
**Cons:** Needs pattern recognition + tool database

### 5. Music - Looper Pedal (Workflow Looper)
Record sequences of actions, layer/modify them, replay optimized versions. Like a loop station for productivity.

**Pros:** Direct workflow optimization, visual/auditory metaphor  
**Cons:** Complex state management

## Selected Approach: #4 - AI Tool Discovery Agent

**Why:**
- **Novelty:** High (proactive research based on observed patterns)
- **Viability:** High (leverage existing research scripts + pattern matching)
- **Impact:** Medium-High (directly improves VS7's toolkit)
- **Fun:** High (autonomous exploration with user approval loop)
- **Chaos:** Medium (controlled discovery, not random)

**Implementation Plan:**
1. Monitor VS7's tool usage patterns in memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md files
2. Identify gaps/inefficiencies (repeated manual tasks, missing integrations)
3. Search GitHub/HN/ArXiv for tools that fill those gaps
4. Evaluate tool quality (stars, activity, documentation)
5. Propose integration as OpenClaw skill
6. Await approval → Build integration or archive

**Exoskeleton Metaphor:**
Doesn't replace VS7's judgment - extends their reach into the tool ecosystem. Like how an exoskeleton amplifies strength without replacing muscles.

## Next Steps
Present to VS7 → If approved, create `ai-tool-discovery/SKILL.md` and implementation scripts.
