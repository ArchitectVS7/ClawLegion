# Agent Organs — Brainstorm Session

**Timestamp:** 2026-02-24 18:47 UTC

**Dice rolls:**
- Source: d100 → 52 (IEEE Spectrum, blocked) → 61 (Nature, redirects) → 64 (ArXiv q-bio) ✓
- Time range: d6 → 2 (24 hours)
- Lens: d10 → 8 (Temporal)
- Modifier: d6 → 4 (Cross-Pollination)
- Format: d6 → 3 (Quick Take)

**Finding:** "Modularity is the Bedrock of Natural and Artificial Intelligence" (ArXiv 2602.18960, ICLR 2025)
- Brains use specialized regions; AI should use specialized modules
- Modularity enables efficient learning + strong generalization
- Aligns with No Free Lunch Theorem (problem-specific inductive biases)

**Brainstorming approaches (Temporal + Cross-Pollination):**

1. **Modularity as Technical Debt Insurance** (score 38)
   - 5 years forward: monolithic agents become unmaintainable
   - Modular agents swap components as models improve
   - Novelty 7, Viability 8, Impact 7, Fun 6, Diversity 10

2. **Cambrian Explosion of Agents** (score 36)
   - 10 years back: expert systems were modular, LLMs went monolithic
   - What if we combined both?
   - Novelty 6, Viability 7, Impact 7, Fun 6, Diversity 10

3. **Modular Agent Organs** (score 42) ✓ **SELECTED**
   - Cross-pollination: biology (heart, lungs, liver)
   - Specialized, irreplaceable, independent failure, clear interfaces
   - Novelty 9, Viability 8, Impact 9, Fun 8, Diversity 8

4. **Modularity Debt Clock** (score 39)
   - Cross-pollination: finance (debt, interest)
   - Track entanglement, accrue interest, pay down debt
   - Novelty 8, Viability 7, Impact 8, Fun 7, Diversity 9

5. **Agent Evolution Through Module Swapping** (score 40)
   - Temporal: evolutionary timescale
   - Gene duplication → module duplication
   - Novelty 8, Viability 7, Impact 8, Fun 7, Diversity 10

**Why Agent Organs won:**
- Highest novelty (9) — fresh biological metaphor
- Highest impact (9) — directly applicable to agent architecture
- Cross-pollination is elegant: organs ≠ modules (organs are specialized, irreplaceable, have clear interfaces)
- Quick Take format fits perfectly (short, punchy, one clear insight)

**Article structure:**
1. Hook: "Your agent needs organs" (not modules)
2. Organ metaphor (heart, lungs, liver — specialized, irreplaceable)
3. Agent organs table (Memory, Planning, Execution, Verification, Perception)
4. Why organs > modules (failure isolation, independent upgrades, clear interfaces, evolutionary pressure)
5. Modularity debt concept (interest accrues, pay it down)
6. Key insight: "Modularity isn't about code organization. It's about survivability."

**Key insight:**
"Organs let organisms survive partial failures. Agent organs should do the same."

**Article format:** Quick Take (250-400 words target, delivered ~400 words)
