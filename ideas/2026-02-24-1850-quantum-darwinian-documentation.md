## Source Finding

**Article:** "Are the Mysteries of Quantum Mechanics Beginning to Dissolve?" by Philip Ball (Feb 13, 2026)

**Key Concept:** Wojciech Zurek's Quantum Darwinism theory explains how classical reality emerges from quantum mechanics:

- **Decoherence**: Quantum objects entangle with environment, "diluting" quantumness
- **Pointer States**: Quantum states that can robustly generate multiple identical imprints
- **Quantum Darwinism**: "Fit" states survive because they replicate efficiently across environment
- **Unique Classical Reality**: All imprints must be identical — consensus reality emerges
- **Epiontic**: Wave function is both epistemic (knowledge) and ontic (existence)

The crucial insight: **Only quantum states that can generate consistent, identical copies become observable reality.**

## Brainstorming Approaches

### Approach 1: Agent Memory Systems (Temporal - 5 years forward)
What if 2031 agent memory uses quantum Darwinism? Only "fit" memories that robustly replicate across contexts survive. Memories generating inconsistent interpretations decohere and fade.

Cross-pollinate with current agent memory systems (MEMORY.md, daily logs).

**Score:**
- Novelty: 8
- Viability: 7
- Impact: 8
- Fun: 7
- Diversity: 7
**Total: 37**

### Approach 2: Code Review (Temporal - 10 years backward)
If we'd applied quantum Darwinism to code review a decade ago: code survives when it generates identical understanding across reviewers. Pointer states = reviewable patterns. Code that can't be consistently understood decoheres naturally.

Compare: modern review practices vs. Darwinian selection.

**Score:**
- Novelty: 7
- Viability: 8
- Impact: 7
- Fun: 6
- Diversity: 6
**Total: 34**

### Approach 3: Agent Tool Selection (Cross-Pollination with active projects)
Apply quantum Darwinism to agent toolkits: tools that survive generate consistent, replicable results across contexts (pointer states). Tools with unpredictable behavior decohere and drop from the library naturally.

Compare: manual tool curation vs. Darwinian tool selection.

**Score:**
- Novelty: 8
- Viability: 9
- Impact: 8
- Fun: 7
- Diversity: 7
**Total: 39**

### Approach 4: Documentation That Survives ⭐
Documentation is like quantum states trying to become classical reality. Docs that survive are "pointer state" docs — they generate identical understanding when copied/shared. Bad docs are superpositions that collapse differently for each reader.

Compare: Traditional documentation (write once, hope for best) vs. Quantum Darwinian documentation (tested for consistent interpretation across readers).

Cross-pollinate with: API docs, technical writing, READMEs.

**Score:**
- Novelty: 9 (fresh metaphor, real pain point)
- Viability: 8 (testable, measurable)
- Impact: 9 (universal problem in tech)
- Fun: 8 (physics → docs is unexpected)
- Diversity: 8 (bridges science and dev)
**Total: 42** 🏆

### Approach 5: API Design (Temporal - looking forward)
Future APIs designed with quantum Darwinism: only endpoints generating consistent, replicable responses across clients become stable interface. Endpoints with inconsistent behavior decohere naturally.

Compare: versioning + deprecation vs. Darwinian API evolution.

**Score:**
- Novelty: 7
- Viability: 8
- Impact: 7
- Fun: 6
- Diversity: 7
**Total: 35**
