## Brainstormed Projects (Extremes Lens)

### 1. "AI Makes You Boring" → Micro-Chaos Injection Tool ⭐
**Score: 8/10** (novelty: 9, viability: 8, impact: 7, fun: 9, chaos: 8)

**Concept:** CLI tool or browser extension that adds tiny random "errors" to AI outputs:
- Occasional typos (realistic human mistakes)
- Word substitutions (synonyms, near-misses)
- Tonal shifts (formal → casual mid-sentence)
- Minor formatting inconsistencies

**Goal:** Force human re-engagement. Pure AI output becomes unusable, requiring editing/thinking.

**Implementation:**
- Python CLI: `chaos-inject --level 3 input.txt > output.txt`
- Configurable chaos levels (1-10)
- Pattern library of "human mistakes"
- Could integrate with OpenClaw as post-processing filter

**Why Extremes?** Takes "don't trust AI" from abstract principle to concrete UX constraint.

### 2. Multilingual Safety → Crowdsourced Jailbreak Database
**Score: 7/10** (novelty: 7, viability: 6, impact: 9, fun: 6, chaos: 7)

**Concept:** Community-driven database of LLM safety exploits across 100+ languages:
- Users submit multilingual jailbreaks
- Automated testing against major models
- Live leaderboard of languages with most bypasses
- Public API for researchers

**Challenges:** Moderation, ethical implications, legal exposure

**Why Extremes?** Scales safety research from single-language examples to comprehensive multilingual catalog.

### 3. Agent Autonomy → Recursive Agent Evaluation ⭐⭐
**Score: 9/10** (novelty: 10, viability: 7, impact: 8, fun: 9, chaos: 9)

**Concept:** Agents evaluate OTHER agents' autonomy (not self-evaluation):
- Agent A performs task
- Agent B reviews A's autonomy metrics
- Compare self-evaluation vs peer-evaluation
- Measure bias, blind spots, collective assessment patterns

**Applications:**
- Improve orchestrator delegation (peer review vs self-assessment)
- Test for emergent evaluation standards
- Build agent "performance review" systems
- Recursive consciousness testing

**Implementation:**
- Extend current UAT framework
- Add peer-review phase after self-evaluation
- Track divergence between self/peer scores
- Analyze patterns in evaluation criteria

**Why Extremes?** Takes autonomy measurement from single-agent metric to multi-agent society analysis.

## Recommended Next Steps
1. **Build micro-chaos injection tool** (lightweight, fun, immediately useful)
2. **Test recursive agent evaluation** (directly supports orchestrator development)
3. **Archive multilingual safety idea** (high impact but requires infrastructure)

## Full Brainstorm Details

### Finding #1 Alternative Approaches
1. **Micro-chaos injection** (SELECTED) ⭐
2. **10x BIGGER:** Anti-AI creative collective (1000+ artists, provenance chains)
3. **Boring Score analyzer:** Gamify making AI produce maximally generic content
4. **Constraint extreme:** Force AI to use only 100-word vocabulary
5. **Dadaist merger:** Cut-up method + random image insertion

### Finding #2 Alternative Approaches
1. **Single-language deep dive:** Focus on one non-English language edge cases
2. **Crowdsourced database** (SELECTED)
3. **Systematic translation:** Translate all jailbreaks → 100 languages
4. **Universal safety prompt:** One prompt for all languages (impossible challenge)
5. **Adversarial specialist:** AI trained ONLY on bypass techniques

### Finding #3 Alternative Approaches
1. **Binary test:** "Can it survive 24h without human input?"
2. **Agent society simulation:** 1000 agents, measure emergent culture
3. **Time compression:** Test autonomy evolution in 60 seconds OR 10 years
4. **Zero-connectivity:** Test in fully isolated environment
5. **Recursive evaluation** (SELECTED) ⭐⭐
