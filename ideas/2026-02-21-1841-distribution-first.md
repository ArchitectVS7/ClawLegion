# Distribution-First Architecture Brainstorm
**Session:** 2026-02-21 18:41 UTC  
**Source:** IndieHackers (d100=48, all-time)  
**Lens:** Temporal (d10=8)  
**Modifier:** Cross-Pollination (d6=4)  
**Format:** Comparison (d6=5)

## Research Source
IndieHackers front page + popular all-time posts

## Top 5 Findings
1. Agency as dual-function (testing ground + distribution) → $10k/mo
2. Trevor's crash-rebuild cycle: $700k ARR → $120k → upper 6 figures
3. "Your SaaS doesn't need a marketing strategy. It needs a distribution habit." (Bazzly)
4. Retention improvement ≠ adding features (FeedBok)
5. "I built 6 features. Now I have no idea which one to focus on."

## Divergent Approaches (Temporal + Cross-Pollination)
1. **The 5-Year Product Cycle** — Agency-as-distribution vs PMF quest; cross-poll with orchestration patterns (31 pts)
2. **The Rebuild Tax** — Intentional failure loops vs continuous iteration; temporal: what if crashes were planned? (35 pts)
3. **Distribution-First Architecture** — Build → distribute vs distribution-as-code; cross-poll with autonomous agents (40 pts) ✅
4. **Retention Inversion** — Feature expansion vs feature removal; temporal: when features cost more than they earn (32 pts)
5. **Focus as Infrastructure** — Manual discipline vs systematized prioritization; cross-poll with multi-agent decision-making (30 pts)

## Selected Approach
**Distribution-First Architecture** (40/50)

**Why it won:**
- Novelty: 8 — Distribution-as-code is underexplored in indie discourse
- Viability: 8 — Real examples exist (agency model, viral mechanics)
- Impact: 9 — Directly addresses the "distribution habit" problem
- Fun: 7 — Temporal + cross-pollination combo reveals interesting parallels
- Diversity: 8 — Shifts conversation from tactics to architecture

## Article Structure (Comparison Format)
1. **Hook:** Build a product, then find distribution — or build distribution into the product?
2. **Traditional Path:** Build → Distribute (manual effort, flexible, linear growth)
3. **Alternative:** Distribution as Code (front-loaded effort, compounds, constrains architecture)
4. **Hybrid Trap:** Trying to do both = confusion and half-measures
5. **Comparison Table:** Time to first dollar, flexibility, manual effort, growth curve, risk, best use case
6. **Verdict:** Pick one based on stage (exploration vs execution)
7. **What's Next:** Audit distribution strategy, track time allocation, study usage-as-distribution patterns

## Cross-Pollination Connection
Parallels with agent orchestration:
- Monolithic agent (manual distribution) vs multi-agent system (distributed growth)
- One-time setup (architecture) vs continuous coordination (habit)
- Emergent behavior from system design vs explicit task execution

## Temporal Insight
5 years from now: Products with embedded distribution will outlast those dependent on founder energy. The question isn't "What can I build?" but "What can I build that spreads itself?"
