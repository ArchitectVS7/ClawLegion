**Date:** 2026-02-21 07:41 UTC  
**Source:** Benedict Evans Newsletter (Culture/Ideas cluster)  
**Time Range:** 30 days  
**Lens:** Adversarial (d10=9)  
**Modifier:** Time Pressure (d6=1)  
**Format:** Tutorial (d6=2)

## Key Finding

Benedict Evans' Feb 2026 essay: "OpenAI has no unique tech, limited engagement, no network effect. Value will come from new experiences they can't invent themselves."

## Brainstorm Approaches

### 1. Build Your Own "OpenAI Moat" in 4 Hours
Flip Benedict's criticism into actionable indie dev strategy. Find defensible AI niches.

**Scores:**
- Novelty: 7 (practical pivot on strategic analysis)
- Viability: 8 (very doable for indie devs)
- Impact: 7 (helps builders find positioning)
- Fun: 6 (practical but not thrilling)
- Diversity: 7 (shifts from analysis to action)
- **Total: 35**

### 2. The Adversarial Playbook: How to Out-Compete OpenAI
Tutorial breakdown of each weakness, concrete exploitation steps.

**Scores:**
- Novelty: 8 (direct competitive framing)
- Viability: 7 (requires good execution)
- Impact: 8 (valuable for anyone in AI space)
- Fun: 8 (adversarial = engaging)
- Diversity: 6 (still in strategy domain)
- **Total: 37**

### 3. Fast-Follow Strategy Tutorial
Teach readers how to be the "fast follower" in their niche. Identify → strip → ship vertical-focused version.

**Scores:**
- Novelty: 6 (established strategy, applied to AI)
- Viability: 9 (very practical)
- Impact: 6 (useful but not groundbreaking)
- Fun: 5 (mechanical)
- Diversity: 7 (execution focus)
- **Total: 33**

### 4. Build a "New Experience" Before OpenAI Does ⭐ SELECTED
Tutorial: Prototype 3 novel AI UX patterns in one day using Claude API. Be the experience layer Benedict predicts will capture value.

**Scores:**
- Novelty: 9 (genuinely new UX patterns)
- Viability: 8 (buildable in one day)
- Impact: 9 (addresses core strategic opening)
- Fun: 9 (building > analyzing)
- Diversity: 8 (shifts to UX/product layer)
- **Total: 43**

**Why it won:** Highest novelty and fun scores. Directly attacks OpenAI's strategic weakness. Moves from analysis to concrete building. Tutorial format works perfectly here.

### 5. The Anti-Moat: Why No Network Effect Is Your Advantage
Contrarian tutorial. Small = nimble. Build fast without scale's drag.

**Scores:**
- Novelty: 8 (contrarian take)
- Viability: 7 (requires good framing)
- Impact: 7 (challenges assumptions)
- Fun: 7 (contrarian is engaging)
- Diversity: 8 (philosophical shift)
- **Total: 37**

## Selected Approach Details

**Concept:** One-day tutorial to build 3 novel AI UX patterns:
1. **Reactive Canvas** — spatial context determines AI response mode
2. **Divergence Engine** — intentionally contradictory responses
3. **Constraint Bot** — progressive degradation to build skill mastery

**Key insight:** OpenAI can't explore every UX direction. That's the opening for indie builders.

**Article structure:**
- Hook: Benedict's strategic question
- Challenge: Build 3 patterns in one day
- Tutorial: Step-by-step for each pattern
- Strategic framing: This is the moat Benedict describes
- CTA: Ship today, build more tomorrow

**Adversarial lens application:** "Who does OpenAI's strategy harm?" → Indie devs who assume they can't compete. This tutorial arms them with the exact attack vector.

**Time Pressure modifier:** Forces concrete, buildable examples. No abstract theorizing — actual code you can run today.
