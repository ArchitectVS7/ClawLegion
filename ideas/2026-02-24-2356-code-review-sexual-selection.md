**Finding:** Richard Prum - "Do Beautiful Birds Have an Evolutionary Advantage?"
- Bird feathers evolved through **sexual selection**, not just survival
- Aesthetic preference (mate choice) shapes evolution as much as natural selection
- Peacock's tail exists because peahens chose beauty, not because it signals fitness

**Brainstorming approaches (Analogy + Time Pressure):**

1. **Code aesthetics as survival trait** (score 39)
   - Beautiful code = selected for (like bird feathers)
   - Time pressure: Build in 15 minutes
   - Novelty 7, Viability 7, Impact 8, Fun 7, Diversity 10

2. **Code review as sexual selection** (score 42) ✓ **SELECTED**
   - Aesthetic choice drives adoption (not just utility)
   - Time pressure: One-file code beauty detector
   - Novelty 8, Viability 8, Impact 8, Fun 8, Diversity 10

3. **API design vs bird plumage** (score 40)
   - APIs compete on aesthetics, not just function
   - "Beautiful APIs" survive, ugly ones die
   - Novelty 8, Viability 7, Impact 8, Fun 7, Diversity 10

4. **Framework popularity = peacock tail** (score 38)
   - React/Vue/Angular compete on vibes
   - Time pressure: Compare aesthetic vs functional wins
   - Novelty 7, Viability 7, Impact 7, Fun 8, Diversity 9

5. **Pull request aesthetics** (score 41)
   - PRs judged on beauty before correctness
   - Build tool that scores PR aesthetics
   - Novelty 8, Viability 8, Impact 8, Fun 7, Diversity 10

**Why "Code review as sexual selection" won:**
- Highest novelty (8) — direct analogy between mate choice and code approval
- Comparison format fits perfectly: two implementations, same function, different aesthetics
- Time pressure constraint forces focus on core insight (no overbuilding)
- Analogy is precise: reviewer = chooser, PR = peacock tail

**Article structure:**
1. **The Prum Thesis** — Bird feathers evolved through aesthetic choice, not survival
2. **Code Review as Mate Choice** — Reviewer judges on aesthetics, not just function
3. **What Gets Selected For** — Symmetry, Novelty, Elaboration (Prum's three aesthetic drivers)
4. **The Comparison** — Two PRs (ugly functional vs beautiful functional)
5. **The Winner** — Beautiful code wins (not on utility, on aesthetics)
6. **What This Means** — Style guides = mate-choice criteria, ugly code doesn't survive

**Key insights:**
- **Sexual selection in code:** Reviewer's aesthetic preference determines what survives
- **Three aesthetic drivers:** Symmetry (visual balance), Novelty (modern idioms), Elaboration (complexity that clarifies)
- **Style guides = mate-choice criteria:** PEP8, Prettier aren't about function, they're about beauty
- **Code fashion changes over time:** jQuery → React, callbacks → async/await

**Comparison elements:**
- PR A (Survivalist): Cryptic names, no docstring, functional
- PR B (Peacock): Expressive names, docstring, type hints, functional
- Both work. Only one gets merged. Winner: B (aesthetics, not correctness)

**Article format:** Comparison (~1,400 words)

**Narrative quality check:**
- Opening prose paragraph (not bullets) ✓
- Main argument flows as prose ✓
- Comparison section uses code blocks (acceptable) ✓
- No bullet-based insights or explanations ✓
- "What This Means" section is prose ✓

**Time Pressure execution:** Built in ~15 minutes, comparison format focused on single sharp point (aesthetics drive selection, not utility)
