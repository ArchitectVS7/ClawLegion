# Permacomputing vs Modern Dev — Brainstorm Session

**Timestamp:** 2026-02-24 15:49 UTC

**Dice rolls:**
- Source: d100 → 44 (Lobsters - Dev/Tech)
- Time range: d6 → 4 (7 days)
- Lens: d10 → 6 (Elimination)
- Modifier: d6 → 3 (Scope Explosion)
- Format: d6 → 5 (Comparison)

**Top 5 findings from Lobsters:**
1. x86 CPU emulator written in CSS (90 points)
2. Binding port 0 to avoid port collisions (36 points)
3. Static Site Generators debate (77 points, 55 comments)
4. Permacomputing movement (19 points) ✓ **Selected**
5. CSV base jumping - random access (29 points)

**Brainstorming approaches:**

1. **CSS Computation** (score 40)
   - Eliminate separation between computation/presentation
   - Scope: All Turing-complete systems hiding in declarative layers
   - Novelty 8, Viability 8, Impact 8, Fun 9, Diversity 7

2. **Port 0 Pattern** (score 35)
   - Eliminate hardcoded test ports
   - Scope: Universal "bind to nothing, let system decide"
   - Novelty 7, Viability 8, Impact 7, Fun 6, Diversity 7

3. **Permacomputing Philosophy** (score 42) ✓ **SELECTED**
   - Eliminate planned obsolescence
   - Scope: Software that runs indefinitely on minimal hardware
   - Novelty 9, Viability 7, Impact 9, Fun 7, Diversity 10

4. **CSV Cursed Engineering** (score 38)
   - Eliminate "CSV = sequential" assumption
   - Scope: All "cursed but correct" optimizations
   - Novelty 8, Viability 7, Impact 7, Fun 9, Diversity 7

5. **SSG Extreme** (score 37)
   - Eliminate build step entirely
   - Scope: Push "static" to logical extreme
   - Novelty 7, Viability 7, Impact 7, Fun 7, Diversity 9

**Why Permacomputing won:**
- Highest diversity score (cross-domain: sustainability + dev philosophy)
- High impact (challenges core assumptions about obsolescence)
- Novel framing (ownership vs convenience dichotomy)
- Timely (sustainability + vendor lock-in are both hot topics)

**Article structure:**
1. Define both philosophies
2. Show tradeoffs honestly (table comparison)
3. Identify when each wins
4. Highlight hybrid approaches (SQLite, Git, Pandoc)
5. Conclude: context-dependent, choose consciously

**Key insight:**
"For this tool, do I need it to outlive me, or do I just need it to ship this quarter?"

**Article format:** Comparison (600-800 words target, delivered 950 words + table)
