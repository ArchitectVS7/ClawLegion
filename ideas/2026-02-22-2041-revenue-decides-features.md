# Revenue Decides Features (Not You)

**Session:** 2026-02-22 20:41 UTC
**Source:** IndieHackers (7 days)
**Domain:** Dev/Tech
**Lens:** Elimination
**Modifier:** Tool Restriction
**Format:** Narrative

## The Finding

IndieHackers post: "I built 6 features. Now I have no idea which one to focus on. Help."

Classic indie hacker paralysis—multiple features, all getting some usage, none dominant. Surrounded by analytics, user feedback, A/B test results. Still can't decide.

## Brainstorming Session

**Lens:** Elimination - What can we remove entirely?
**Modifier:** Tool Restriction - Only tools unused in last 7 days

### Approaches Generated:

1. **Eliminate the Product** (Score: 42)
   - Reframe: 6 features = 6 products fighting for oxygen
   - Kill 5, let 1 breathe
   - Novelty: 8, Viability: 9, Impact: 10, Fun: 7, Diversity: 8

2. **Eliminate Customer Choice** (Score: 35)
   - Force one feature on every user for 30 days
   - The one they keep using is your product
   - Novelty: 7, Viability: 7, Impact: 8, Fun: 6, Diversity: 7

3. **Eliminate the Founder** (Score: 43) ← SELECTED
   - No analytics, no dashboards, no feedback tools
   - Just revenue graph for 30 days
   - Whichever feature generates money without founder intervention wins
   - Novelty: 9, Viability: 8, Impact: 9, Fun: 8, Diversity: 9

4. **Eliminate Feature Launch** (Score: 36)
   - Only ship one feature publicly
   - Keep other 5 as internal tools
   - See if market pulls them from you vs. you pushing
   - Novelty: 8, Viability: 7, Impact: 7, Fun: 7, Diversity: 7

5. **Eliminate Development** (Score: 37)
   - Code freeze for 30 days
   - Only marketing, only conversations
   - Feature users keep asking about = your product
   - Novelty: 7, Viability: 9, Impact: 8, Fun: 6, Diversity: 7

## The Insight

Most founder decision paralysis isn't a data problem—it's a proximity problem. You're too close to see clearly. Revenue is the only signal that cuts through founder bias.

Tool restriction amplifies this: no analytics = no rationalization. Can't justify a feature because "engagement is up" or "users say they love it." Just money. Did it work or not?

## Article Strategy

**Format:** Narrative
**Hook:** "You've built six features. Now you're paralyzed. Which one should you focus on?"
**Core Argument:** Eliminate all analytics for 30 days. Watch only revenue graph. Let money decide.
**Emotional Arc:** Empathy (we've all been there) → Challenge (you're avoiding the truth) → Solution (radical simplification) → Call to Action (actually do it)

**Why This Lands:**
- Every indie hacker has felt feature paralysis
- Most advice says "more data" when the problem is "too much noise"
- Revenue-only constraint is actionable and extreme enough to be memorable
- Forces confrontation with uncomfortable truth: most features don't matter
