## Source Finding

**Gingoduino** - Free, open-source music theory engine for Arduino and embedded systems. Recreates music theory as a library for resource-constrained hardware.

## Brainstorming Approaches

### 1. Theory as Firmware (Score: 35)
- **Angle:** 5 years future - music theory becomes standard library in every IoT device
- **Novelty:** 8 | **Viability:** 7 | **Impact:** 6 | **Fun:** 7 | **Diversity:** 7
- **Why interesting:** Theory as infrastructure, not add-on
- **Why not selected:** Too broad, less surprising

### 2. The Theory Gap (Score: 31)
- **Angle:** 10 years past - we had MIDI but no accessible theory layer for hardware
- **Novelty:** 6 | **Viability:** 8 | **Impact:** 5 | **Fun:** 6 | **Diversity:** 6
- **Why interesting:** Historical context for why this matters now
- **Why not selected:** Retrospective, not forward-looking enough

### 3. Theory as Constraint Liberation ⭐ (Score: 42)
- **Angle:** System's POV - from chip's perspective, theory isn't rules—it's computational efficiency
- **Novelty:** 9 | **Viability:** 8 | **Impact:** 8 | **Fun:** 8 | **Diversity:** 9
- **Why interesting:** Inverts human assumption that constraints limit; for machines, constraints optimize
- **Core insight:** Random exploration is computationally expensive; theory collapses infinite decision space into navigable lookup
- **SELECTED:** Highest score, most counter-intuitive perspective

### 4. Embedded Theory + AI Agents (Score: 34)
- **Angle:** Composition - every hardware device has theory built-in AND talks to AI
- **Novelty:** 7 | **Viability:** 6 | **Impact:** 7 | **Fun:** 7 | **Diversity:** 7
- **Why interesting:** Future interaction between embedded theory and AI models
- **Why not selected:** Too speculative, AI angle less grounded

### 5. Hardware vs Creator Need (Score: 32)
- **Angle:** Inversion - theory engine isn't for device, it's to liberate creator from choice paralysis
- **Novelty:** 7 | **Viability:** 7 | **Impact:** 6 | **Fun:** 6 | **Diversity:** 6
- **Why interesting:** Human-focused rather than machine-focused
- **Why not selected:** Less surprising than chip's-eye view

## Selected Approach Development

**Core Thesis:** From an embedded chip's perspective, music theory isn't restrictive—it's relief. Every random exploration burns cycles; theory is a lookup table that turns expensive search into cheap reference.

**Key Insights:**
- Constraints collapse decision space (128 MIDI notes → 7 scale notes → 3-5 chord tones)
- Theory = compression for computation
- Embedded systems don't want artistic freedom; they want to finish the loop before watchdog timer resets
- Theory engines are to music what vector databases are to AI: turning search into lookup

**Future Implications:**
- Smart instruments that personalize constraints based on player behavior
- Generative music that's theory-coherent without being AI-heavy
- Modular theory stacks (swap Western harmony for Javanese pelog like a ROM cartridge)
- Theory negotiation between devices (auto-harmonizing modular synths)

**Narrative Arc:**
1. Hook: Unlimited time/power = every melody, but you gave it 16MHz and a battery
2. The Gap: MIDI without meaning, no middle layer 5-10 years ago
3. Liberation Paradox: Constraints limit humans, optimize machines
4. Computational comparison: Random exploration vs. theory-guided (cycles per decision)
5. Future unlocks: Teaching instruments, theory cartridges, device negotiation
6. Conclusion: Constraints aren't limitations—they're compression
