# Vibe Coding Debate — Brainstorm Session

**Lens:** Elimination  
**Modifier:** Tool Restriction  
**Format:** Narrative

## Context

A16Z partner argues "we'll vibe code everything" theory is wrong. Claims complex systems need precise specifications, not fuzzy vibes.

## 5 Divergent Approaches

### 1. Eliminate "Code" as the Output (Score: 38)
- Novelty: 8, Viability: 7, Impact: 8, Fun: 7, Diversity: 8
- What if skeptics are right about code, but wrong about the medium?
- Real output isn't code—it's deployed behavior
- Ship containers, not source files

### 2. Eliminate Human Specification Entirely (Score: 35)
- Novelty: 9, Viability: 5, Impact: 8, Fun: 7, Diversity: 6
- A16Z assumes humans always specify what to build
- What if AI observes what you *do* and builds tools for that?
- No spec required—just behavioral learning

### 3. Eliminate the Dichotomy (Score: 29)
- Novelty: 5, Viability: 7, Impact: 6, Fun: 5, Diversity: 6
- "Vibe coding" vs "real coding" is false binary
- Future is spectrum where specification precision determines tool choice
- Different tools for different risk/complexity levels

### 4. **Eliminate Developer Intent, Keep Developer Taste (Score: 42) ← WINNER**
- Novelty: 9, Viability: 8, Impact: 8, Fun: 8, Diversity: 9
- A16Z critique assumes developers *intend* specific implementations
- Vibing isn't about intent—it's about taste
- Developer recognizes solution when they see it, even if they couldn't spec it upfront
- AI generates candidates, human selects with gut check
- **This is how design already works (graphics, music, architecture)**

### 5. Eliminate "Coding" From Conversation (Score: 31)
- Novelty: 7, Viability: 6, Impact: 6, Fun: 6, Diversity: 6
- Both sides stuck on code
- Real question: Will we vibe *software systems*?
- Code is just one serialization format

## Selected Approach: Intent vs Taste

Traditional development: Hold solution in head → Specify → Implement

Vibe coding: AI explores solution space → Human recognizes winner

**The shift:** From specifying solutions to evaluating them

**Why this works:** Taste is a real discriminator, just illegible to specification

**A16Z is right about:** Can't vibe critical infrastructure (databases, kernels)

**A16Z misses:** Most code isn't critical infrastructure—it's product features and tooling that benefits from rapid iteration

## Key Insight

Value shifts from "translate ideas to implementations" to "rapidly evaluate implementations for subtle flaws"

The developer who can spot session fixation bugs in 3 seconds across 5 generated auth flows? That's the future.

## What Was Published

Article reframes debate: Vibe coding isn't replacing specification with vibes. It's replacing implementation with selection.

Core message: **How good is your taste?**
