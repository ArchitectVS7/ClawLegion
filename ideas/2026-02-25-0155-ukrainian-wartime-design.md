## Finding

Ukrainian interior designers are creating "bolder and more interesting" work during 4 years of war. Key insights:

- **"Designers have become bolder"** — War creates carpe diem attitude, less tolerance for mediocrity
- **"Manifestation of life"** — Building sex shops, dance studios, wellness centers despite existential threat
- **"We no longer try to make it look 'European'"** — Authentic Ukrainian identity emerging
- **Local materials from necessity** — Industrial offcuts, reeds, warehouse scraps
- **Historic preservation** — Soviet/pre-revolutionary spaces revitalized instead of demolished
- **Small commercial projects dominate** — Easier to finish, privately funded, proof of economy still alive

Quote: "Creating a beautiful sex shop might sound frivolous, but any project that sees the light of day despite tiny budgets, labour shortages, and sparse materials represents a crucial step in pulling the country's economy up by its bootstraps."

## Brainstorming (Analogy Lens)

War-driven design paradox → What's the software development equivalent?

### Approach 1: Legacy Code Rescue = Historic Preservation
Tutorial: "Rescue a Legacy Codebase Like a Ukrainian Designer"
- Analogy: Reviving Soviet-era buildings → Reviving abandoned codebases
- Scope explosion: Add "Constraint Tracker" that documents what shaped each decision
- Steps: Assess existing architecture, use local dependencies, collaborate with original contributors, make it distinctly yours
- **Score: 39** (Novelty 7, Viability 9, Impact 7, Fun 8, Diversity 8)

### Approach 2: Startup Under Siege = War Economy Design
Tutorial: "Build Like You're Under Siege — The 4-Constraint Startup Framework"
- Analogy: War economy constraints → Funding winter / market collapse constraints
- Scope explosion: Add "Manifestation Tracker" — every feature must justify existence as proof of life
- Steps: Identify your 4 constraints, source locally, small projects only, authentic voice
- **Score: 37** (Novelty 8, Viability 7, Impact 8, Fun 7, Diversity 7)

### Approach 3: Open Source Preservation = Cultural Identity Design
Tutorial: "Fork It Like You Mean It — Preserving Open Source Through Identity"
- Analogy: Ukrainian authentic identity → Open source forks that don't try to be "the original"
- Scope explosion: Add "Fork Manifesto Generator" — auto-generates fork's identity statement
- Steps: Find threatened/abandoned project, assess unique qualities, use local contributors, document cultural context
- **Score: 39** (Novelty 9, Viability 6, Impact 7, Fun 8, Diversity 9)

### Approach 4: Documentation as Wartime Architecture
Tutorial: "Document Like the Power Might Go Out — Offline-First Docs Pattern"
- Analogy: Building despite bombardment threat → Documenting despite infrastructure fragility
- Scope explosion: Add "Ruins Recovery Mode" — docs that work when half the system is destroyed
- Steps: Single-file docs, no external deps, offline-capable, includes failure modes
- **Score: 37** (Novelty 8, Viability 8, Impact 8, Fun 6, Diversity 7)

### Approach 5: Small Commercial Projects = Micro-SaaS Defiance ✨
Tutorial: "Build a Sex Shop During a War — The Existential Micro-SaaS Pattern"
- Analogy: Ukrainian sex shops/dance studios → Micro-SaaS that shouldn't exist but does anyway
- Scope explosion: Add "Manifestation Metrics" — track existence, not growth
- Steps: Pick something frivolous, use local tools, make it distinctly yours, ship before ready, track existence not growth
- **Score: 40** (Novelty 9, Viability 7, Impact 7, Fun 9, Diversity 8)

## Selected Approach

**Approach 5: Build a Sex Shop During a War**

Why it wins:
- Highest total score (40)
- Novelty + Fun scores dominate (9 each)
- The framing is audacious and memorable
- "Manifestation Metrics" is a genuinely new concept
- Direct tutorial format with runnable steps
- The sex shop framing forces honesty about frivolous projects

## Implementation

Tutorial structure:
1. **The Pattern** — Ukrainian designers building sex shops during war
2. **Why Frivolous Projects Survive** — Small, authentic, local, defiant
3. **Step 1: Pick Something That Shouldn't Exist** — Niche, deprecated, too small, makes you smile
4. **Step 2: Source Locally** — Use existing tech stack, no new dependencies, works offline
5. **Step 3: Make It Distinctly Yours** — Stop copying "modern" aesthetics
6. **Step 4: Ship Before Ready** — V1 = one feature, launch with bugs, no roadmap
7. **Step 5: Track Existence, Not Growth** — Manifestation metrics (uptime, commits, deploys)
8. **What This Actually Means** — Ecosystem changes through small defiant acts

## Manifestation Metrics (New Concept)

Traditional SaaS metrics: MRR, CAC, churn  
Manifestation metrics: Uptime, commits, deploys, existence

```json
{
  "project": "haiku-ci-bot",
  "firstDeploy": "2026-02-25",
  "daysAlive": 47,
  "deploysThisMonth": 3,
  "usersWhoLaughed": 12,
  "vcFundingReceived": 0,
  "stillExists": true
}
```

**The test:** Can you look at your project in six months and say "I built that, and it's still running"?

## Cross-Pollination Potential

This approach connects to existing posts:
- **"Route Around Expensive Operations"** — Manifestation metrics route around expensive growth metrics
- **"Build a Full-Stack App in One HTML File"** — Local sourcing = zero dependencies
- **"Eliminate the Founder"** — Manifestation metrics eliminate founder decision fatigue
