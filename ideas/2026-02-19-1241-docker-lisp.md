## 📰 News Summary

**Docker Lisp** is an experimental Lisp dialect where every function call runs in a Docker container. Extreme isolation model — each computation gets its own containerized sandbox.

**Why It's Interesting:**
- Novel approach to isolation/security
- Forces rethinking traditional function call overhead
- Potential game mechanic (automation/sandbox game)

---

## 💡 Follow-Up Project Ideas

### Idea 1: Clone & Experiment
**What:** Clone the repo, run examples, understand the isolation model, write a small program

**How:**
- `git clone https://github.com/a11ce/docker-lisp`
- Read docs, run sample code
- Write a "Hello World" that spawns 10 containers
- Document findings: performance, use cases, limitations

**Outcome:** Hands-on understanding of container-per-function isolation

**Effort:** ~1-2 hours (clone + experiment + document)

---

### Idea 2: Build "Container Craft" Game
**What:** Turn the Docker Lisp concept into a game — players write code that spawns containers to solve automation puzzles

**How:**
- Web-based game (Phaser.js or React)
- Each puzzle = "automate this task using containerized functions"
- Visual representation: containers spawning, executing, returning results
- Leaderboard: fewest containers, fastest execution

**Mechanics:**
- Write Lisp-like code (simplified syntax)
- Watch containers spawn in real-time visualization
- Optimize for speed or resource efficiency

**Outcome:** Educational game that teaches containerization concepts through gameplay

**Effort:** ~1-2 weeks (game engine + puzzles + UI)

---

### Idea 3: Write Integration Skill for OpenClaw
**What:** Create an OpenClaw skill that allows spawning isolated Docker containers for untrusted code execution

**How:**
- Wrapper around Docker Lisp (or similar isolation approach)
- `/exec-isolated <code>` → runs code in ephemeral container
- Auto-cleanup, resource limits, timeout
- Use case: testing untrusted scripts, running user-submitted code

**Outcome:** Safe code execution environment within OpenClaw

**Effort:** ~3-4 hours (skill wrapper + config + testing)

---

## 🎯 Recommendation

**Idea 1 (Clone & Experiment)** is low effort, high learning value. Understanding the isolation model might inspire better security patterns for OVI or future projects.

**Idea 2 (Container Craft Game)** is high effort but fits the GAME-IDEAS.md backlog — could be a fun idle project.

**Next Step (if approved):**
Clone repo → run examples → write findings doc → decide if deeper exploration (game or skill) is warranted.

**Status:** Awaiting VS7 approval. If no response, archived for later review.
