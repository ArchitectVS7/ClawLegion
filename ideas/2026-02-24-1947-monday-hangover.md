# The Monday Hangover — Brainstorm Session

**Timestamp:** 2026-02-24 19:47 UTC

**Dice rolls:**
- Source: d100 → 38 (Dev.to - Dev/Tech) ✓
- Time range: d6 → 5 (30 days)
- Lens: d10 → 2 (Extremes)
- Modifier: d6 → 5 (Perspective Shift)
- Format: d6 → 1 (Narrative)

**Finding:** DEV Community post — "OpenClaw posting peaks on weekends"
- Sunday is biggest day for agent coding
- Developers use weekends as "third space" (can't experiment at day job)
- Build → Share → Demonstrate skills → Catalog learnings
- Pattern: Weekend building, Monday abandonment

**Brainstorming approaches (Extremes + Perspective Shift):**

1. **10x Time Compression** (score 38)
   - What if weekend = entire sprint?
   - Perspective: The code's POV on weekend warriors
   - Novelty 7, Viability 7, Impact 7, Fun 7, Diversity 10

2. **The Monday Hangover** (score 41) ✓ **SELECTED**
   - 90% of weekend code abandoned by Monday
   - Perspective shift: What happens to weekend code on Monday?
   - Why does 10% survive? What distinguishes it?
   - Novelty 8, Viability 8, Impact 8, Fun 7, Diversity 10

3. **Hackathon Archaeology** (score 39)
   - Dig through old weekend projects
   - What fossils remain?
   - Novelty 7, Viability 7, Impact 7, Fun 8, Diversity 10

4. **The Weekend-Only Developer** (score 40)
   - What if you ONLY coded on weekends?
   - Extreme constraint: 2 days/week, 104 days/year
   - Novelty 8, Viability 6, Impact 8, Fun 8, Diversity 10

5. **Sunday Deployment Risk** (score 37)
   - Weekend code goes live Monday
   - What breaks?
   - Novelty 6, Viability 8, Impact 7, Fun 6, Diversity 10

**Why Monday Hangover won:**
- Highest viability (8) — directly actionable for weekend builders
- Highest impact (8) — challenges the "build → post → abandon" cycle
- Perspective shift is elegant: weekend code's POV, Monday's harsh reality
- Narrative format fits perfectly (story of abandoned code)

**Article structure:**
1. Hook: "I was born on a Sunday... On Monday morning, they closed the tab."
2. The Weekend Surge (context: Sunday is peak agent coding day)
3. The 90% Abandonment Rate (why weekend code dies)
4. The 10% That Survives (what distinguishes survivors)
5. Weekend Builder's Checklist (4 questions to ask before building)
6. Honest Truth (most weekend code *should* die — it's practice)
7. What's Next (build for Monday, or admit it's for Sunday)

**Key insight:**
"Weekend code doesn't fail because it's bad. It fails because it was built for Sunday satisfaction, not Monday survival."

**Article format:** Narrative (~1,000 words)
