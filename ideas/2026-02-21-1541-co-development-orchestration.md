# Co-Development as Permanent Orchestration

**Session:** 2026-02-21 15:41 UTC  
**Source:** Game Developer (gamedeveloper.com)  
**Time Range:** 7 days  
**Lens:** Elimination (#6)  
**Modifier:** Time Pressure (#1)  
**Format:** Comparison (#5)

## Research Context

**Key findings from Game Developer:**

1. **Sucker Punch: 5yr → 4yr dev cycles**
   - Brian Fleming (outgoing studio head): "We really wish that number was four"
   - NOT about team size, AI tools, or offshoring
   - "The real secret... is going to be designing games that can be built in shorter periods of time"
   - "Be a sculptor of that project and subtract away all the things that are not essential"

2. **Co-development as industry salvation**
   - Podcast episode: "Can co-development save the game industry?"
   - External studios (Virtuos, Keywords, Sweet Baby Inc, Wolfjaw) as specialized services
   - Industry crisis: 3-year economic downturn, studio size/structure questions
   - Large teams risk disorganization + financial vulnerability

3. **Industry pattern:**
   - AAA games taking 5+ years to ship
   - Studios either scaling up (causing disorganization) or staying lean (causing bottlenecks)
   - Co-dev positioned as "bring in specialists for overflow work"

## Elimination Lens Applied

**Core assumption to eliminate:** Co-development as one-off outsourcing

**Question:** What if co-dev studios weren't contractors but *permanent orchestration partners*?

## Brainstormed Approaches

### 1. Eliminate "dev time" as the optimization target
- **Thesis:** Problem isn't "5 years is too long" but "5 years with no intermediate value"
- **Solution:** Ship 1.0 in year 2, iterate publicly (games-as-service accidentally solved this)
- **Score:** 34/50 (Novel: 6, Viable: 8, Impact: 7, Fun: 6, Diversity: 7)
- **Weakness:** Doesn't address Sucker Punch's specific constraint (they want premium single-player)

### 2. Eliminate fixed team size
- **Thesis:** What if you hired 250 people for 2 years instead of 100 for 5?
- **Solution:** Temporary scaling forces simplification (can't build complexity with time pressure)
- **Score:** 31/50 (Novel: 7, Viable: 5, Impact: 6, Fun: 6, Diversity: 7)
- **Weakness:** Fleming explicitly says "we don't think growing the team is the right strategy"

### 3. Eliminate "one game" unit
- **Thesis:** Why do AAA studios only ship one product per 5-year cycle?
- **Solution:** Split 100-person team into two 50-person teams, ship two games on 2-year offset
- **Score:** 37/50 (Novel: 8, Viable: 6, Impact: 8, Fun: 7, Diversity: 8)
- **Strength:** Eliminates downtime between projects, doubles output
- **Weakness:** Management overhead, IP dilution risk

### 4. AI scope visibility
- **Thesis:** Humans are bad at saying no; "be a sculptor" requires tools
- **Solution:** AI agent calculates production cost of every feature proposal in real-time
- **Score:** 33/50 (Novel: 6, Viable: 7, Impact: 7, Fun: 7, Diversity: 6)
- **Strength:** Makes scope inflation visible before it compounds
- **Weakness:** Doesn't directly address Fleming's "design games that can be built faster"

### 5. Eliminate co-dev as outsourcing ← **SELECTED**
- **Thesis:** Co-dev studios should be permanent orchestration partners, not contractors
- **Solution:** Multi-year alliances, shared infrastructure, persistent relationships across games
- **Score:** 41/50 (Novel: 9, Viable: 6, Impact: 9, Fun: 8, Diversity: 9)
- **Strength:** 
  - Zero ramp-up time (co-dev already knows your engine/team/vision)
  - Cross-project learning (lessons compound)
  - Specialized evolution (co-dev gets *really good* at your specific problems)
  - Directly addresses coordination overhead
- **Weakness:**
  - Lock-in risk
  - Reduced competition
  - Shared failure

## Article Structure (Comparison Format)

**Model A: Traditional Co-Development (What We Have Now)**
- How it works: Bid on scopes, contract for task duration, relationship ends at ship
- Optimizes for: Flexibility, risk distribution, cost control
- Costs: Ramp-up time, context fragmentation, redundant infrastructure, no learning loops

**Model B: Permanent Orchestration Partners (What Could Exist)**
- How it works: Permanent alliances, own entire verticals (e.g., "narrative for all Sucker Punch games"), shared tooling
- Optimizes for: Zero ramp-up, cross-project learning, specialized evolution, proactive optimization
- Costs: Lock-in risk, reduced competition, shared failure

**The Honest Tradeoff:**
- Model A wins for: Experimental studios, unpredictable scopes, risk mitigation priority
- Model B wins for: Genre-focused studios, predictable production, speed priority

**Sucker Punch verdict:** Perfect candidate for Model B (two Ghost games shipped, third likely, predictable production)

**AI Orchestration Parallel:** Same choice in multi-agent systems (spawn-per-task vs. persistent specialists)

**Signal to watch for:**
- Multi-year co-dev partnerships announced
- Shared tooling/infrastructure with external partners
- Co-dev studios credited as "Associate Studios" not vendors

## Cross-Domain Connections

**Music:** Session musicians vs. band members (co-dev = session musicians, orchestration = band)

**DevOps:** Consultants vs. platform teams (temporary integration vs. persistent infrastructure)

**Biology:** Symbiosis vs. parasitism (mutualism requires long-term relationships, not one-off exchanges)

## Why This Scored Highest

- **Novelty:** Nobody's talking about co-dev this way (still framed as outsourcing)
- **Impact:** If studios adopt this, it changes industry structure (not just one company's process)
- **Diversity:** Completely different framing from existing posts (we haven't covered studio economics yet)
- **Fun:** There's a clear villain (coordination waste) and a clear solution (persistent partnerships)

## Implementation Potential

This isn't just theory. Studios could:
1. Announce 5-year co-dev partnerships with specific verticals assigned
2. Share GitHub repos, Slack workspaces, CI/CD pipelines with co-dev partners
3. Include co-dev leadership in early design sprints (not just execution)

First-mover advantage: Studio that does this first gets to cherry-pick the best co-dev talent for long-term relationships.
