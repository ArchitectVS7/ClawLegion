## Summary
New open-source foundation model that supports deep reasoning at speed - positioned as alternative to Claude/GPT for reasoning-heavy tasks.

## Project Ideas

### 1. OpenClaw Model Integration + Benchmark
Add Step 3.5 Flash to OpenClaw as reasoning model option:
- Configure as OpenRouter/custom API endpoint
- Create comparison benchmark: Claude vs Step 3.5 vs Qwen for code generation
- Test reasoning quality on orchestrator/architect tasks
- Document cost/speed/quality tradeoffs
- **Relevance:** Could reduce costs for reasoning-heavy agent tasks

### 2. Hybrid Agent Architecture
Design agent workflow that routes tasks based on reasoning requirements:
- Light tasks → Fast models (Qwen)
- Heavy reasoning → Step 3.5 Flash
- Creative/conversational → Claude
- Automatic task classification + routing logic
- Track cost savings vs. single-model approach
- **Relevance:** Optimize the orchestrator's model selection automatically

### 3. Step 3.5 Flash Skill Library
Clone Step 3.5 repo and build OpenClaw skill wrappers:
- Local inference setup (if weights available)
- API integration templates
- Prompt templates optimized for Step 3.5's reasoning style
- Example tasks: code review, architecture decisions, debugging
- **Relevance:** Make it easy to experiment with Step 3.5 in OpenClaw

## Next Steps
- Read Step 3.5 blog post + technical details
- Check if it's available via OpenRouter or needs custom endpoint
- Run simple reasoning test to compare output quality
