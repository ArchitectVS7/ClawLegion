## Finding

From IndieHackers front page (29 upvotes, 32 comments):
> "Your SaaS doesn't need a marketing strategy. It needs a distribution habit." — Bazzly

The thesis: founders should commit to daily distribution activities (Twitter, blog posts, Reddit comments, etc.) instead of trying to craft elaborate marketing strategies.

## Brainstorming Session

**Elimination lens:** What if we remove a core assumption entirely?  
**Scope Explosion:** Add an unexpected dimension or scale the idea way up

### Approach 1: Eliminate "Distribution" Entirely → Marketing IS the Habit
- Counter-thesis: The problem isn't strategy vs. habit, it's that founders treat marketing as a campaign instead of a practice
- What if we eliminate the word "distribution" and just say "do marketing every single day"?
- **Scope Explosion:** Extend this to ALL business disciplines (finance habit, hiring habit, support habit)
- **Score:** Novelty 7, Viability 8, Impact 7, Fun 6, Diversity 6 = **34**
- **Why it didn't win:** Too close to the original advice, just rebranded

### Approach 2: Eliminate the Founder Entirely → Distribution-as-Code ✅
- What if we eliminate the need for a human to have a "habit" at all?
- Build distribution into the product itself (viral loops, referral mechanics, API-first architecture)
- **Scope Explosion:** Every feature ships with built-in distribution (share buttons, embed codes, webhooks that post to social)
- **Examples:** Figma multiplayer, Loom instant share, Notion public pages, Calendly signature
- **Score:** Novelty 9, Viability 7, Impact 8, Fun 8, Diversity 8 = **40**
- **Why it won:** Genuinely challenges the premise that distribution is a founder activity

### Approach 3: Eliminate the Distinction Between Product and Distribution
- What if distribution ISN'T separate from the product?
- Every feature is also a distribution channel (Figma's multiplayer, Loom's instant sharing, Notion's public pages)
- Counter-argument: "Distribution habits" are a patch for products that don't naturally spread
- **Score:** Novelty 8, Viability 8, Impact 9, Fun 7, Diversity 7 = **39**
- **Why it didn't win:** Very close to #2, but less actionable

### Approach 4: Eliminate "Organic" Distribution → Pay or Die
- Controversial take: The "distribution habit" advice only works for B2B SaaS with high LTV
- Counter-thesis: Most founders should just buy ads and stop pretending Twitter threads are a strategy
- **Scope Explosion:** Calculate the true hourly cost of "content marketing habits" vs. paid acquisition
- **Score:** Novelty 7, Viability 6, Impact 7, Fun 8, Diversity 6 = **34**
- **Why it didn't win:** Less interesting than automation angle, would need real data to not sound like hot air

### Approach 5: Eliminate the Calendar → Event-Driven Distribution
- What if "daily habit" is the wrong frequency?
- Distribution should be event-driven: new user → automated referral prompt, feature launch → coordinated blitz, milestone → case study
- **Scope Explosion:** Build a distribution event system like you'd build a notification system
- **Score:** Novelty 8, Viability 8, Impact 7, Fun 7, Diversity 8 = **38**
- **Why it didn't win:** Solid but narrower in scope than #2

## Selected Thesis

**"Distribution Shouldn't Be a Habit — It Should Be Your Product"**

If your product requires daily Twitter threads to grow, you don't have a distribution problem — you have a product problem. The best products distribute themselves through:
- Shareable outputs (Canva, Grammarly)
- Multiplayer mechanics (Slack, GitHub)
- Network effects (marketplaces, social networks)

Distribution habits are a founder subsidy — manually doing what the product should do automatically.

## Article Details

- **Format:** Counter-Argument (500-700 words)
- **Path:** `_drafts/2026-02-21-distribution-shouldnt-be-a-habit.md`
- **Hook:** "If distribution requires a habit, your product doesn't distribute itself."
- **Structure:** Problem → Three Levels of Built-In Distribution → Counter-Argument → When Habits Make Sense → What to Build Instead
- **Outcome:** Article staged for review in _drafts/

## Implementation Ideas

If this resonates, build:
1. A distribution feature checklist for product reviews
2. A "distribution health score" — % of features that spread vs. % that require manual promotion
3. A case study library of products with built-in distribution (Figma, Loom, Notion, Calendly, etc.)
4. A counter-example analysis: products that genuinely need external distribution vs. those that should self-distribute
