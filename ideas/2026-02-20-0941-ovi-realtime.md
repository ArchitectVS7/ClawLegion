# OVI Real-Time Mode - Consistency Diffusion Integration

**Date:** 2026-02-20 09:41 UTC  
**Source:** HN #2 - Consistency diffusion language models (14x faster inference)  
**Dice Rolls:** d20=14 (HN), d6=3 (7 days), d6=5 (Composition lens)

## Core Idea

Upgrade OVI (Orchestrated Voice Interface) to use consistency diffusion models for near-instant responses, making voice conversations feel like talking to a human instead of waiting for a chatbot.

## Research Context

Together.AI published research showing consistency diffusion can achieve 14x faster inference with no quality loss. This enables real-time conversational AI that responds fast enough to feel natural.

## Divergent Approaches (Composition Lens)

1. **+ Music synthesis:** Real-time AI jam session tool - multiple agents improvise together
2. **+ Game AI:** NPCs that think/respond in real-time combat (no lag)
3. **+ Voice interfaces (WINNER):** OVI upgrade for conversational fluidity
4. **+ Code review:** Review code AS you type (like Copilot but critical)
5. **+ Live translation:** Real-time multilingual conversation with zero delay

## Why This One Won

- **Novelty:** 8/10 - Cutting-edge research application
- **Viability:** 9/10 - Direct application of published technique
- **Impact:** 9/10 - Transforms OVI from "useful" to "feels alive"
- **Fun:** 8/10 - Building the future of voice interfaces
- **Chaos:** 6/10 - Straightforward but powerful

**Total:** 40/50

## Technical Requirements

1. **Research consistency diffusion implementation** - Check Together.AI docs/papers
2. **Identify compatible model API** - Does Together.AI offer this via API?
3. **OVI integration points** - Where does inference happen in current architecture?
4. **Latency benchmarking** - Measure current vs. consistency diffusion response times
5. **Fallback handling** - What if fast inference unavailable?

## Implementation Sketch

```
[User Speech] → STT → [Consistency Diffusion LLM] → TTS → [Audio Output]
                              ↓ (14x faster)
                      Near-instant response
                      Conversational flow maintained
```

**Key difference:** Current OVI has noticeable pauses between turns. Real-time mode feels like a conversation, not Q&A.

## Bonus: Other Strong Ideas

- **Exoskeleton Mode for OpenClaw:** Shift from "delegate to agents" to "AI amplifies your actions"
- **OpenClaw Sidebar Skill:** Generic AI copilot pane for terminal/browser/editor

## Next Steps (If Approved)

1. Read Together.AI research paper
2. Check API availability
3. Prototype latency comparison (current vs. consistency diffusion)
4. Design OVI Real-Time Mode architecture
5. Implement and test
