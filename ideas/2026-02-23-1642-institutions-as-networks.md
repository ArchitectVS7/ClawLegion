# Institutions as Networks of Threatened Individuals

**Session:** 2026-02-23 16:42 UTC
**Source:** Marginal Revolution (Culture/Ideas cluster, 30d)
**Lens:** Analogy (d10=4)
**Modifier:** Tool Restriction (d6=2) — used geopolitical case study
**Format:** Narrative (d6=1)

## Research Findings

**Daniel Litt - AI Math Capabilities:**
- Math professor/AI skeptic expects to lose 2030 bet against AI
- "I think I was not correctly calibrated as to the capabilities of existing models"
- Pattern: Experts updating timelines downward

**Mexico Drug War Strategy:**
- U.S. helping Mexico target individual drug cartel leaders, not institutional structures
- "Trump doctrine" = focus on lead individuals, not governments
- **Key insight:** "What the U.S. is supplying here is 'more decisive action,' rather than some new, detailed understanding of the Mexican dilemma"

**Cartels as Loose Syndicates:**
- "Cartels" is overused word — they're loose syndicates, not colluding monoliths
- Decisions made by threatened individuals, not unified organizations
- Pattern: Naming conventions shape (mis)understanding

**The Great Forgetting:**
- Center for American Progress proposes 2-year food price freeze
- Would force credit card companies to absorb costs via regulatory pressure
- Pattern: Economic knowledge degradation (each generation forgets price controls don't work)

## Analogy Application

**Cross-domain pattern identification:**

1. Mexico targeting → Bug bounties (institutions are networks of threatened individuals)
2. "More decisive action" → CI/CD (teams need capability to act, not more analysis)
3. Calibration crisis → AI timeline updates (slowness was in expert perception, not tech)
4. "Cartels" vs "syndicates" → Software naming (language shapes strategy)
5. Price controls → Software economic laws (collective amnesia of first principles)

## Divergent Approaches (5 Generated)

### 1. The Deploy Button Problem (40/50)
- **Insight:** Teams analyze forever because they CAN'T act, not because they don't understand
- **Core:** Need capability, not understanding
- **Analogy:** U.S. supplying decisive action → CI/CD as execution capability

### 2. The Calibration Crisis (37/50)
- **Insight:** Experts keep updating AI timelines downward — miscalibration, not tech change
- **Core:** The "slowness" was in perception, not reality
- **Analogy:** Litt expecting to lose bet → Everyone's AI timeline updates

### 3. Naming Warfare (39/50)
- **Insight:** Calling things wrong leads to wrong strategy
- **Core:** "Cartels" vs "loose syndicates" → "Microservices" vs "distributed monolith"
- **Analogy:** Language determines battle plans

### 4. The Great Forgetting (33/50)
- **Insight:** Collective amnesia of basic truths every generation
- **Core:** Price controls don't work / Monoliths aren't evil
- **Analogy:** Economic knowledge degradation → Software knowledge degradation

### 5. The Individual vs. Institutional Paradox (42/50) ⭐ **SELECTED**
- **Insight:** Institutions are just networks of threatened individuals
- **Core:** Target nodes, not graphs. Design for topology, not mythology.
- **Analogy:** Drug war targeting → Open source maintainer burnout → Bug bounties → Sales champion programs

## Selected Approach Details

**Why this one won:**
- **Novelty (9/10):** Framing institutions as network topologies is fresh
- **Viability (7/10):** Testable via organizational case studies
- **Impact (9/10):** Changes how you approach system design entirely
- **Fun (8/10):** Geopolitical → software bridge is engaging
- **Diversity (9/10):** Connects warfare, open source, sales, activism

**Core Argument:**
1. Institutions don't make decisions — threatened individuals in network topologies do
2. "Cartel" is mythology; reality is Bob, Sarah, and Chen under competing pressures
3. Network topology determines which targeting strategies work (star vs. mesh vs. hierarchical)
4. Framework: Map topology → Identify critical nodes → Understand threat landscape → Make acting in your direction the safe move

**Tool Restriction Applied:**
- Used geopolitical case study as narrative device (Mexico drug war)
- Unused in last 7 days (recent articles focused on AI, software, design)

**Narrative Structure:**
- Opening: Mexico cartel leader targeting (hook)
- Bridge: Open source maintainer burnout (software connection)
- Deepening: Network topology analysis (the insight)
- Framework: 4-step decision topology mapping (actionable)
- Ending: Predictions and adaptive response (what's next)

## Article Metadata

**Title:** "Institutions Are Just Networks of Threatened People"
**Path:** `_drafts/2026-02-23-institutions-are-just-threatened-people.md`
**Word Count:** ~950 words
**Format:** Narrative
**Categories:** systems, strategy
**Tags:** organizational-design, game-theory, decision-making, warfare

**Excerpt (Hook):**
> The U.S. just helped Mexico take out a major drug cartel leader. Not the cartel. The *leader*.

## What's Next

**If this pattern holds:**
- Warfare continues shifting from institutional to individual targeting
- Organizational change accelerates around "champion programs"
- Decentralized systems win specifically because they resist individual targeting

**Potential follow-ups:**
- Map network topologies for major open source projects
- Build "critical node identifier" tool for organizational analysis
- Case study: How decentralized protocols resist individual targeting
- Framework: Design organizations to be resilient to node targeting
