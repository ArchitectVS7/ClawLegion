# Preemptive Agency — Brainstorm Session

**Timestamp:** 2026-02-25 03:50 UTC

**Dice rolls:**
- Source: d100 → 51 (AI Alignment Forum, rate limited) → backup roll → 39 (IndieHackers, Dev/Tech cluster) ✓
- Time range: d6 → 4 (7 days)
- Lens: d10 → 8 (Temporal)
- Modifier: d6 → 4 (Cross-Pollination)
- Format: d6 → 1 (Narrative)

**Continuity check:** Last 3 domains [AI/ML, Science, Creative] → avoided those, selected Dev/Tech ✓

**Finding:** "I went from 40 support tickets/month to 8 — by stopping the question before it was asked"
- Founder redesigned interface to surface help before user asks
- Predictive UX: recognize patterns, answer before question is typed
- 80% reduction in support load

**Brainstorming approaches (Temporal + Cross-Pollination):**

1. **"Your AI Product Is Not A Real Business" in 5 years** (score 38)
   - What will "real business" mean when every product has AI?
   - Novelty 7, Viability 7, Impact 7, Fun 7, Diversity 10

2. **Predictive UX → Preemptive Agent Actions** (score 44) ✓ **SELECTED**
   - "Stop the question before it's asked" → agent that predicts user intent ahead of time
   - Cross-pollinate with "Manifestation Metrics" (existence-tracking from Ukrainian wartime design)
   - **New concept: Preemptive Agency** (act before user realizes they need it)
   - Novelty 9, Viability 8, Impact 9, Fun 8, Diversity 10

3. **Compound retention as temporal leverage** (score 40)
   - 1% churn reduction (10%→9%) compounds exponentially over years
   - Novelty 8, Viability 7, Impact 8, Fun 7, Diversity 10

4. **Failure recovery → Project Necromancy 2.0** (score 41)
   - Trevor's $700k ARR→$120k crash→recovery maps to abandoned projects
   - Cross-pollinate with existing "Project Necromancy" draft
   - Novelty 8, Viability 8, Impact 8, Fun 7, Diversity 10

5. **Agency distribution in 10 years** (score 37)
   - Will agencies still exist when AI can do execution?
   - Novelty 7, Viability 6, Impact 7, Fun 7, Diversity 10

**Why "Preemptive Agency" won:**
- Highest novelty (9) — extends predictive UX to autonomous action
- Temporal lens perfectly applied: 5 minutes, 5 hours, 5 days ahead
- Cross-pollination with "Manifestation Metrics" strengthens concept (both about proving existence before asking)
- Strong viability (8) — pattern detection + confidence thresholds are buildable
- High impact (9) — reduces cognitive load, catches issues early, avoids panic

**Article structure:**
1. **The Support Ticket Problem** — 40→8 tickets via predictive UX
2. **Preemptive Agency** — Predictive UX applied to autonomous systems
3. **Three Temporal Horizons** — 5 minutes (micro), 5 hours (workflow), 5 days (strategic)
4. **The Line Between Helpful and Creepy** — Prediction confidence determines action vs suggestion
5. **Implementation: The Preemptive Engine** — Pattern detector + confidence threshold + feedback loop
6. **What This Looks Like in Practice** — Terminal agent, monitoring agent, dependency agent examples
7. **The Honest Tradeoffs** — What you gain (cognitive load reduction) vs what you don't get (perfect predictions)

**Key insights:**
- **Preemptive agency = predictive UX + autonomy** (agent acts, not just suggests)
- **Three time scales matter:** Micro (5 min), Workflow (5 hrs), Strategic (5 days)
- **Confidence thresholds prevent creepiness:** ≥80% act, 50-79% suggest, <50% silent
- **Feedback loop is critical:** Track whether preemptions were used, adjust confidence over time

**New concept: Preemptive Agency**
- Stop waiting for the user to ask
- Act when the pattern says they're about to need it
- Not suggestion (still requires human decision) — preemptive action (autonomy)

**Examples given:**
- **Terminal agent (5 min):** After SSH, auto-tail logs (learned pattern: SSH → tail 92% of time)
- **Monitoring agent (5 hrs):** Deploy at 3 PM → prepare monitoring at 7:45 PM (historical bug arrival at 8 PM)
- **Dependency agent (5 days):** Detect API deprecation in GitHub issues → file task 6 weeks before shutdown

**Narrative quality check:**
- Opening prose paragraph (not bullets) ✓
- Main argument flows as prose (no bullet-based insights) ✓
- Examples use prose narrative structure ✓
- Implementation section uses sub-headers + prose ✓
- No slide-deck bullet lists ✓

**Cross-pollination connection:**
- "Manifestation Metrics" (Ukrainian wartime design) tracked existence before asking for validation
- Preemptive Agency acts before user asks for action
- Both concepts about proving value through presence, not permission

**Article format:** Narrative (~1,600 words)

**Published to:** `_drafts/2026-02-25-your-agent-should-know-what-you-need-before-you-do.md`

**Time:** Temporal lens + narrative format produced three-horizon framework naturally (micro/workflow/strategic)
