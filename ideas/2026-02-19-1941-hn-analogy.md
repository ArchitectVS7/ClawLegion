**Date:** 2026-02-19 19:41 UTC
**Dice:** d20=7 (HN), d6=3 (7d), d6=4 (Analogy)

## Findings & Divergent Ideas

### 1. "Don't Trust the Salt" - Multilingual LLM Safety
**Link:** https://royapakzad.substack.com/p/multilingual-llm-evaluation-to-guardrails
**Score:** 154 pts | 64 comments
**Analogy:** Like a musical instrument that sounds in tune in one key but not others

**Ideas:**
1. **Safety Tuning Fork** - Build a multilingual safety detector that "resonates" at different frequencies (languages) to expose guardrail weaknesses
   - Score: N=8, V=7, I=9, F=6, C=7 → **37/50**
2. **Translation Adversarial Game** - Two-player game: one tries to jailbreak in language X, other translates back to English to prove intent
3. **Ecosystem Resilience Test** - Like testing if a species survives in different climates, test if safety rules survive cross-linguistic translation
4. **Harmony Check** - Tool that scores consistency across languages like musical intervals
5. **Polyglot Red Team Bot** - AI that automatically generates multilingual adversarial prompts using translation drift

### 2. "Measuring AI Agent Autonomy" (Anthropic)
**Link:** https://www.anthropic.com/research/measuring-agent-autonomy
**Score:** 41 pts | 15 comments
**Analogy:** Like measuring how far a bird can fly from its nest before needing to return

**Ideas:**
1. **Autonomy Radius Visualizer** - 3D map showing agent capability range (like animal territory maps)
2. **Foraging Efficiency Metric** - Score agents on resource gathering vs. energy spent (optimal foraging theory)
3. **Migratory Pattern Tracker** - Chart agent behavior over time to see if it develops "migration patterns"
4. **Nesting Behavior Analysis** - How often does agent return to "home base" vs. solve independently?
5. **Predator-Prey Simulation** - Adversarial testing where "predator" agents try to expose autonomy limits

### 3. "AI Makes You Boring"
**Link:** https://www.marginalia.nu/log/a_132_ai_bores/
**Score:** 282 pts | 190 comments
**Analogy:** Like using auto-tune so much you forget your natural voice

**Ideas:**
1. **Voice Fingerprint Tracker** - Measures writing style drift before/after heavy AI use
2. **Jazz Improv Mode** - AI that deliberately introduces "wrong notes" to force creative recovery
3. **Boring-ness Meter** - Analyze text for AI clichés, score on originality scale ⭐ **SELECTED**
   - Score: N=9, V=8, I=7, F=8, C=6 → **38/50**
   - **Why:** Directly addresses real concern, simple to build, immediately useful
4. **Human Spice Injector** - Browser extension highlighting generic AI phrases
5. **Authenticity Game** - Can readers tell your content vs. AI-polished? Track score

### 4. "Against Theory-Motivated Experimentation"
**Link:** https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/26339137261421577
**Score:** 25 pts | 20 comments
**Analogy:** Like composing music theory-first vs. jamming until something sounds good

**Ideas:**
1. **Jam Session Logger** - Dev tool encouraging "try stuff" before "plan stuff"
2. **Theory vs. Practice Dashboard** - Track predictions vs. reality
3. **Empirical First IDE** - Suggests "just try it" experiments before reading docs
4. **Rock Science Lab** - Environment rewarding serendipitous discovery
5. **Reverse Engineering Game** - Build first, derive theory later

## Selection

**Winner: Boring-ness Meter (#3.3)**
- Simple CLI/web tool that scores text for AI-generated patterns
- Use markers: "delve," "it's important to note," "leverage," hedging language, over-enthusiasm
- Output: Originality score 0-100, highlighted phrases, human alternative suggestions
- Tech: Simple regex + GPT-4 for semantic analysis
- Delivery: CLI tool + browser extension

**Awaiting VS7 approval to proceed.**
