## SELECTED APPROACH: Low-Latency Synth Parameter AI

**Rationale:**
- Aligns with VS7's music production background
- Fast reasoning models enable real-time parameter adjustment (previously impossible)
- Practical application: Studio production + live performance
- High novelty: No existing tools do real-time AI-driven synth control
- Implementation path: Step 3.5 Flash API → MIDI/OSC bridge → DAW integration

**Next Steps:**
1. Research Step 3.5 Flash API access
2. Prototype MIDI/OSC listener for parameter changes
3. Build simple "suggest filter adjustment" proof-of-concept
4. Test latency requirements (target <50ms for real-time feel)

**Potential Challenges:**
- API latency might exceed real-time requirements
- Need robust audio analysis to provide context to AI
- MIDI/OSC parameter mapping complexity
- Cost per inference (real-time = high API call volume)
