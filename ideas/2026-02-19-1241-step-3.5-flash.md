## 📰 News Summary

**Step 3.5 Flash** is a new open-source reasoning model optimized for speed. Claims competitive performance with Claude/GPT-4 on reasoning tasks while delivering faster response times. Strong community interest (HN front page, active discussion).

**Why It Matters:**
- OSS alternative to proprietary reasoning models
- Speed-focused (could reduce OVI latency)
- Active development/community

---

## 💡 Follow-Up Project Ideas

### Idea 1: OVI Model Benchmarking Suite
**What:** Build a test harness to benchmark Step 3.5 Flash vs current models (Claude Sonnet 4.5, Qwen Coder) on OVI-specific tasks

**How:**
- Define test scenarios (briefing generation, voice transcription accuracy, task planning)
- Run same prompts through multiple models
- Measure: latency, accuracy, cost, output quality
- Generate comparison report

**Outcome:** Data-driven model selection for OVI (maybe Flash is faster for briefings, Sonnet for complex reasoning)

**Effort:** ~2-3 hours (build harness + run tests + analyze)

---

### Idea 2: Flash-Powered Speed Mode for OVI
**What:** Add `/ovi quick` command that uses Step 3.5 Flash for ultra-fast responses

**How:**
- Configure Flash as secondary model in OpenClaw
- Wire `/ovi quick` → routes to Flash instead of Sonnet
- Optimize prompts for Flash's reasoning style
- Test latency improvements

**Outcome:** Two-tier OVI system — `/ovi` (thorough, Sonnet) vs `/ovi quick` (fast, Flash)

**Effort:** ~4-5 hours (config + integration + testing)

---

### Idea 3: Write Comparative Analysis Article
**What:** Synthesize HN discussion + model docs + personal testing → "Step 3.5 Flash vs Claude Sonnet: When to Use Which"

**How:**
- Read HN comments (44 comments, extract key debates)
- Test both models on identical prompts
- Document strengths/weaknesses
- Publish to blog or GitHub

**Outcome:** Public resource + forces deep understanding of model trade-offs

**Effort:** ~3-4 hours (research + testing + writing)

## 🎯 Recommendation

**Idea 1 (Benchmarking Suite)** is the most immediately useful. We're already using multiple models (Sonnet, Qwen, potentially Flash) — having real data on performance trade-offs would inform future decisions.

**Next Step (if approved):**
1. Define 10 test scenarios (briefing, code generation, voice transcription, task breakdown, etc.)
2. Build simple bash script to run same prompts through `openclaw sessions send` with different model overrides
3. Collect: response time, token usage, output quality (scored 1-5)
4. Generate markdown comparison table

**Status:** Awaiting VS7 approval. If no response, archived for later review.
