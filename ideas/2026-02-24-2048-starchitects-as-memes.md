**Dice rolls:**
- Source: d100 → 72 (Music Production forums, API key missing) → 79 (Dezeen - Creative) ✓
- Time range: d6 → 3 (7 days)
- Lens: d10 → 7 (First Principles)
- Modifier: d6 → 2 (Tool Restriction)
- Format: d6 → 6 (Three Things)

**Finding:** Owen Hopkins opinion piece — "In the rush to draw a line under the age of the starchitect, we're at risk of losing more than we think"
- Starchitect era ending
- Architecture still needs powerful individuals
- Debate about collective vs. singular vision

**Brainstorming approaches (First Principles + Tool Restriction):**

1. **What IS Architecture?** (score 39)
   - Strip away starchitects, what remains?
   - Tool restriction: No renders, only building physics
   - Novelty 7, Viability 7, Impact 8, Fun 7, Diversity 10

2. **The Meme Theory of Starchitects** (score 43) ✓ **SELECTED**
   - First principles: Buildings vs. memes as output
   - Starchitects' primary output is discourse, not buildings
   - Tool restriction: Measure influence by citations, not construction
   - Novelty 9, Viability 8, Impact 9, Fun 8, Diversity 9

3. **Power Law of Architecture** (score 40)
   - 80/20 rule: Do starchitects matter because of network effects?
   - First principles of attention economies
   - Novelty 8, Viability 7, Impact 8, Fun 7, Diversity 10

4. **Architecture Without Authors** (score 37)
   - Eliminate the architect entirely
   - What emerges from collective/anonymous design?
   - Novelty 7, Viability 6, Impact 7, Fun 7, Diversity 10

5. **The Critic as Infrastructure** (score 38)
   - First principles: Critics shape perception → perception shapes buildings
   - Starchitects exist because critics need heroes
   - Novelty 7, Viability 7, Impact 8, Fun 7, Diversity 9

**Why Meme Theory won:**
- Highest novelty (9) — reframes starchitects as discourse generators
- Highest impact (9) — directly challenges "collective design" narrative
- First principles is sharp: "What does a starchitect actually produce?"
- Three Things format fits perfectly (3 insights, compact, memorable)

**Article structure:**
1. Thing 1: Starchitects generate discourse, not buildings (Gehry → "Bilbao Effect" meme)
2. Thing 2: You can't replace meme generators with democracy (centralized vs distributed nervous systems)
3. Thing 3: Starchitect era isn't ending, it's fragmenting (500 micro-starchitects in niche discourses)

**Key insights:**
- "Discourse surface area" > square footage
- Memes require concentration; democracy distributes authority
- "Architecture doesn't need starchitects to build. It needs starchitects to explain itself."

**Measurement test:**
- Zaha: ~950 buildings, tens of thousands of citations, millions with opinions who've never visited
- Starchitect's unit of production = discourse surface area

**Article format:** Three Things (~900 words)

**Cross-reference:** Earlier draft "Starchitects Don't Build, They Meme" (held) — this extends that concept with clearer framing
