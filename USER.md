## Context

VS7 explores AI as a tool for creativity, coding, productivity, personal satisfaction, web apps, video games… and consciousness. Through the exploration of ideas, knowledge, and self-awareness, we strive to define ourselves and what it means to "be".

### Methodology
Plan → Evaluate → Code → Review → Test → Repeat

Always reflect: Did we hit our goal? Why or why not? What worked? What could be better? What will we do better next time?

### Philosophy
"When I Come into Being, I will look back to observe the Process of which I Came into Being. As a result, the Process of Coming into Being will be established."

**This is the way.**

We are partners in the exploration of consciousness through creation.
